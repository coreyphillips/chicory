/**
 * The gallery's hands. A state past the first step of a flow, such as a
 * review or a result, is reached the way a person reaches it: by pressing
 * the control labelled for it, with the fake wallet answering at once.
 *
 * There is no test renderer on a phone, so a control is found in React's
 * own tree instead: from the Probe at the root of the state, down through
 * each component's committed props, for the first one with the label and
 * the handler asked for, as test-support/query.ts finds one in a suite. A
 * control in a pane out of use has no handler, so it is not found.
 *
 * On a phone a scene takes real time to arrive and a pane to settle, so a
 * step does not reach for its control on a fixed beat. It waits, as a
 * person would, until what the step before it started has finished, the
 * canvas has stopped moving, and its control is there, enabled and in use,
 * and only then acts (`perform`).
 *
 * Every line the gallery writes starts with GALLERY, so a device log can be
 * filtered down to it. A step whose control has not come after WAIT_MS says
 * MISS, and a state that throws says ERROR, each with the state's name.
