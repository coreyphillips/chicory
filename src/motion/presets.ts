/**

 * first and the outgoing one unmounts after its fade (REDESIGN.md 3.5).
 *
 * Each preset is a function and reads Reduce Motion when it is called, which
 * is at render: a component that re-renders after the setting changes picks
 * up the calmer version. Under Reduce Motion every preset is a plain
 * crossfade of 160ms or less, because nothing should travel through space.
 *
 * Every one runs on a steady clock (`steady`): the frame that mounts what
 * enters can take a long while to paint, and an entrance counted by the
 * frames' clock would be over, or its delay spent, before it was seen.
