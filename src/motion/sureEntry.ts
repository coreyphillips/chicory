 * the view it was entering keeps its first values for good. After one cold
 * launch on a phone, the activity sheet stayed below the screen and the
 * status dot at nothing, while the rest of the canvas built as it should. It
 * could not be made to happen again on demand; Reanimated's issue #9608 was
 * a stall of the same kind, fixed before the 4.7.0 the app uses.
 *
 * So an entrance that matters says when it has ended, and one that has not
 * ended within its grace is taken to have stalled: the view is drawn again,
 * under a new key and with no entrance, where it rests.
