 * Endless loops: an orbit, a breath, a halo, a chase (REDESIGN.md 3.5).

 * periodic function of it, at rest on every whole number. A paused loop
 * picks up exactly where it stopped, and one that ends eases to the nearest
 * whole number, so nothing snaps back. Under Jest the clock lands on its
 * next whole number at once, which is the resting pose.
 *
 * Drive only transform and opacity with a clock, on a view around a still
