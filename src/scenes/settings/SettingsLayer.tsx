/**
 * Settings, the one scene that may keep words on screen (REDESIGN.md rule
 * 2): its title and close control, a failed refresh if there is one, then
 * everything it holds. A recovery phrase still to be saved is drawn by
 * Settings itself, as its leading section.
 *
 * Its root carries the copy guard's marker, `scene-settings`, which lets
 * the guard skip everything under it. No other scene may render one; only
 * the setup surfaces do (the new wallet sheet, and the setup panel a phase
 * opens for network setup or the recovery phrase), and none of them is ever
 * drawn beside Settings.
 *
 * On a test network its pull to refresh turns in slate rather than bloom, as
 * the page under it draws (`SettingsScreen`).
 *
 * Its bar grows with the text size, which Settings does not cap: the title
 * keeps to its one word and gives way before the close control does, so the
 * close stays on screen at every size. The close grows with the text as the
 * page's glyphs do (`glyphScale`), its target with it.
 *
 * The page scrolls under the bar into a short roast fade (`TitleFade`), and
 * under the home indicator to the screen's edge: the inset is room at the
 * end of what scrolls, not a margin that cuts the page off above it.
 *
 * It hosts the page (`SettingsHost`): Android back reaches the page's own
 * steps through the stage, and a field that scans a code, the primary
 * node's address or the address the wallet empties to, opens the stage's
 * scan overlay over Settings rather than a camera of its own
 * (`useScanRequest`). What the page reads of the wallet after its own
 * changes is the quiet read (`session.refresh`); only saving or retrying the
 * primary node, and a pull, restart and resync the wallet behind the
 * spinner.
