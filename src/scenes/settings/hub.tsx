 * The parts Settings is built from as a grouped hub (REDESIGN.md 6,
 * Settings): the frame every item is drawn in, the group headers, the rows
 * that open in place, act at once or switch, the disc behind each row's
 * glyph, and the value a row shows beside its label.
 *
 * A group's card is not a view of its own. Each row draws its share of it
 * by where it sits (`HubEdge`): only the corners at the card's edge are
 * rounded, and a husk hairline joins a row to the one above it, inset to
 * the label column. So the page stays one flat list of keyed items, and a
 * row can join a card, leave it, or move from one place to another as
 * itself, its corners easing to its new place as it goes.
 *
 * Every control follows the canvas rule: it takes touches only while the
 * pane it is drawn in is in use.
