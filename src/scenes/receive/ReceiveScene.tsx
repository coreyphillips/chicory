 * Receive, in the top slot under the status row and the mini strip, where
 * the balance rests while it is open (REDESIGN.md 7, T2). `sceneKey` is the
 * key of the scene this Receive is, for anything in it that must tell
 * whether it is still the scene the stage shows, overlays aside
 * (`useIsCurrentScene`).
 *
 * The scene answers Android back for the screen, and leaves a payment that
 * completes to the canvas to feel, which it does once for every region
 * (`useIncoming`). It lays no ground of its own: the canvas's backdrop shows
 * through, and draws the tints the screen asks for, night while an offline
 * receive is chosen and sage as a request is paid (REDESIGN.md 3.2, G3). It
 * runs to the bottom edge, so it keeps its content clear of the system bar,
 * and it measures its slot, since the screen inside the scroll view cannot:
 * the amount step fits that room with its way on pinned to the bottom.
