 * stop. `item` is the live payment, so a status that changes while it is
 * open changes here too; `from` is the tapped row, for the card to grow out
 * of.
 *
 * Grown out of a row, the card carries the header's ring and amount out of
 * it too, from where the row drew them. It folds back into its row when it
 * closes onto the list it came from, which stays at this stop. Back to home
 * the list is on its way down, so the card fades instead. While it is open a
 * poll can move the row, so it is found again whenever the history changes.
