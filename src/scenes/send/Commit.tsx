 * Where a review is committed (REDESIGN.md 5 and 6, Send): the hold inside

 * retracts round the refresh that takes the hold's place. While the balance
 * is too old to spend against, the hold gives way to a dust control whose
 * tap shakes and refreshes the balance instead.
 *
 * Once the hold commits the quote is used: its ring fades away as the flash
 * rises, on the UI thread with the hold, rather than once the payment's
 * render comes (`spent`), and nothing it could say applies to the payment
 * any more, so the hold stays, with its orbit, whatever the quote's clock
 * or the balance's age would have made of it. Money is going out.
 *
 * A screen reader commits the hold with one action, so the hold says the
 * whole review with it: `summary`, the total, the fee and every engine
 * warning, and then the time the quote has left, which the ring shows and
 * does not say. Handlers are given only while a tap does something, as the
 * controls on the canvas take them. `ref` is whichever control is shown, for
 * the screen to move a screen reader to it.
