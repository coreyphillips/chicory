 * The sheet's drag between home and the whole list (REDESIGN.md 7, T5).

 * scroll. From the list it moves only once the list is at its top and the
 * finger goes down, or when the drag began on the grip and the filter bar
 * above the list. Past either stop it rubber-bands, and while it moves the
 * balance shrinks and the action row fades with it.
 *
 * Let go, it goes where the finger threw it, or past 40% up or 25% down,
 * springing on with the finger's speed. A tick marks crossing the threshold
 * mid drag and a soft tap the snap. The stage then moves to the scene the
 * sheet landed on, through the same action a tap would dispatch; the canvas
 * starts its own spring for that, so the sheet's spring is set again after
 * it, carrying the finger's speed rather than starting from rest.
 *
 * Returns the gesture, for the sheet and for the list to scroll alongside,
 * and `onScroll` for the list.
