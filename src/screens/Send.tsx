 * mark that says how it went. A request whose earlier payment is pending or
 * unknown never reaches a review: it lands on the held ring (rule 6). Nor
 * does one that is paid: an invoice, or a Bitcoin request that names its
 * amount, lands on its paid mark at rest, however it comes back. The
 * request holds its place from step to step while what is under it
 * crossfades, so each step blends into the next rather than replacing it.
 *
 * The screen says nothing in words. Each state is a glyph, a ring, a colour
 * and a motion, and its words are what a screen reader hears and what a long
 * press shows.
 *
 * As each step settles a screen reader lands on its primary element
 * (REDESIGN.md 9), and what the step says aloud waits until it has: a review
 * lands on its amount, at the head of the sum, never on the hold; a quote
 * running out or the balance going stale lands on the control that takes
 * the hold's place, and a fresh quote back on the amount; a result or the
 * held ring on its mark; and back in compose, on the amount.
 *
 * Amounts are shown in `unit`, the one the balance is in, and sats as
 * `₿2,000` when `symbol` is on. While amounts are hidden (`masked`) a result
 * and the held ring show theirs as dots, as the fee paid; a review never
 * does, since it is where the payment is checked before it is sent. A screen
 * reader always hears sats.
 *
 * A payment holds the stage busy for SEND_GRACE_MS at most. One still out
 * after that lets the stage go and moves to the held ring, so Close works
 * and the history is a tap away while the call goes on; its answer is
 * recorded whenever it comes, and shown here if the held ring still is:
 * a payment that completed resolves the ring where it stands.
 *
 * On the canvas, `onScan` opens the scan overlay and the Send scene hands the
 * code back through `receive`. Rendered on its own, with no `onScan`, the
 * camera opens inside it instead. `onDone` takes a payment home once it has
 * been seen to complete, or to go out on chain, where the history follows
 * it (`confirming` in scenes/send/model), and `onDetail` opens the payment
 * a held request is waiting on.
