 * Home: the balance, the pill of what is spendable and what is on its way,

 * are no words on it. The balance is the hero, the vessel under it says what
 * is waiting and why, and the action row is three circles: Send, Scan and
 * Receive.
 *
 * Tapping the hero rolls it between sats and BTC, and a long press hides it;
 * a screen reader has both as actions. Pulling the pane down opens the
 * status row's mark petal by petal, through the canvas's `pull`, and letting
 * go once it is in full flower starts a refresh. An old balance gates the
 * actions, which say so and refresh when tapped rather than act.
 *
 * On the canvas `progress` carries the panes: `hero` shrinks the balance into
 * a mini strip, fading the vessel first, which rests in the band under the
 * status row that Send and Receive leave clear (MINI_STRIP), or in the row
 * itself under Activity and a payment's detail. The balance is one element
 * all the way there, its unit holding a readable size as the figures shrink,
 * so it is never drawn twice. While Send or Receive is open it shows what
 * can be spent (`spendable`): a different figure rather than money moving,
 * so it changes in place, where money moving rolls. `bar` carries the action
 * row away: the circles not tapped shrink and are gone within 140ms, and the
 * tapped one travels and grows toward the scene it opens, whole until it
 * hands over to the scene's own control. Drawn on its own it rests at home. The activity it once
 * previewed is the sheet's now; `onActivity` and `onDetail` stay for the
 * callers that still pass them.
