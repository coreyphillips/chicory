/**
 * Where the first minute of a cold start goes, written down once it is over.
 *
 * The wallet page opens on its cached figures and the engine then boots on
 * the same JavaScript thread, so a launch that looks ready can still drop
 * taps and scrolls for seconds while the engine loads, the vault opens, the
 * network map is imported and the primary's gossip is stored. Nothing on
 * screen says which. This report does. From the top of index.js it notes
 * when each step of the boot first happened (`markBoot`, and `markEngine`
 * for the engine's own timings), every time the thread was too busy to run
 * a 50ms timer on time (a stall), what the wallet's SQLite did, how the
 * session's reads went, and the taps a moving pane refused. When the window
 * closes it prints four `CHICORY_PERF` lines, which
 * `adb logcat -s ReactNativeJS:V | grep CHICORY_PERF` reads off a phone, and
 * writes the same four to the diagnostic log under phase `perf`, so they
 * travel in the report Settings > Diagnostics copies. That page lists only
 * the app's own errors, so they never show as one.
 *
 * Every time in the report is in milliseconds since the report started,
 * before the app's own code had loaded.
 *
 * It costs a timer every 50ms and a clock read per SQLite statement for one
 * minute, and nothing after it. Only index.js starts it, so under Jest every
 * hook here does nothing: no suite sees its timers or its lines unless the
 * suite starts it on purpose.
