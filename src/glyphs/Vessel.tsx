/**
 * The pill under the hero: what can be spent now, solid, beside what is on
 * its way, as glass (REDESIGN.md 5, Vessel). `vesselVisual` decides how it
 * looks; this draws and moves that.
 *
 * It is a hairline while everything is spendable and swells when money is
 * in flight or out of reach. Light sweeps the glass, seeds bob in it below
 * the channel floor, and the glyph on its right end names why the money
 * waits. Money in a channel that is not connected, more than a reserve
 * explains (`unreachableSats`), takes the left end as a honey hatch, with
 * the unplug on that end drifting while it lasts. When money moves into
 * the channel the solid part grows into the glass and a cream ripple runs
 * along the seam. A tap opens it wide enough to show both figures for
 * three seconds, which a screen reader already has in the label.
 *
 * `stale` dims it with the hero. A hidden balance hides the split too, since
 * the proportion alone says something.
 *
 * On a test network slate stands in for bloom, in the solid part, the glass
 * and the glyph, so play money never looks like real money.
 *
 * Why the money waits is said as well as drawn: the label reads the split,
 * the value names the wait, and a long press on the glyph whispers it
 * (REDESIGN.md rule 3).
