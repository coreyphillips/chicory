/**
 * The chicory bloom (REDESIGN.md 5): the mark, the loader and the lock bud.
 *
 * `open` is how far the petals have unfolded, from a closed bud (0) to the
 * full flower (1). When it changes each petal springs to it in turn, as the
 * unfold passes it. `mode` is the loop it runs while nothing else happens:
 * a slow breath, the chase that says it is loading, or the ratchet of a
 * refresh. `breath` 'center' keeps the petals still and breathes the centre
 * alone, for a setup still under way (REDESIGN.md 6, setup pending). `tone`
 * follows the network and the wallet's state and crossfades when it
 * changes, and `halo` is the honey ring a pending backup puts around it.
 * `detail` 'mark' drops the veins and draws a plain centre, and is the
 * default below 40pt, where the tips also keep three teeth instead of five.
 *
 * `event` plays when its `key` changes after the bloom has mounted. A burst
 * and a shake play once. A wilt, a fold and a fall hold for as long as the
 * event stays that kind, and a bloom that mounts with one starts in its pose.
 *
 * `opening` is a pull on the petals, from 0 to 1, read on the UI thread so
 * the bloom follows a finger without drawing again. While it is past 0 the
 * petals follow it instead of `open`: they fold, and one more opens on the
 * reveal spring each twelfth of the way, so the flower is whole at 1. Back
 * at 0 they return to `open`. The status row's mark opens this way with a
 * pull on the home pane (REDESIGN.md 6, manual refresh).
 *
 * `lit` makes the flower a count, of the words of a recovery phrase as they
 * are typed (REDESIGN.md 6, Backup and setup). The first twelve light the
 * petals in turn, clockwise from the top, and a second ring behind, half a
 * petal round and a quarter longer, lights from the thirteenth. A petal not
 * yet lit stands dormant and half open, and lights on the reveal spring. The
 * ring behind shows once the first is whole, and past 24 every petal turns
 * radish. Whoever counts plays the burst and the shake.
 *
 * `unfoldOnExit` is how a bloom leaves when its view is taken away, such as
 * the lock's bud as the lock opens (REDESIGN.md 7, R-1): each petal opens
 * from where it stands to the full flower on the reveal spring, as the
 * unfold passes it, and the flower holds open while whatever carries it off
 * moves it, then fades in the last moment of that many milliseconds. Its
 * drawings keep their look rather than fade on the way out. Under Reduce
 * Motion the petals dip out and come back open within a crossfade, and hold
 * still. A count does not leave this way.
 *
 * Each petal is its own view, turned about the centre, around a still SVG:
 * the loops move only transforms and opacity, on the UI thread.
