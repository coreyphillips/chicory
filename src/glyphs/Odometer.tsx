/**
 * A rolling amount (REDESIGN.md 5, Odometer). Each digit is a clipped column
 * of "0..9,0" that rolls to the digit's position, keyed by its place value so
 * a digit keeps its column as the amount grows. BTC always shows all eight
 * decimals, with the zeros after the last significant one in dust.
 *
 * A cell is exactly one line of its figures tall, and a rolling digit fades
 * as it slides over the cell's edge, so no part of a neighbouring digit shows
 * above or below it mid-roll.
 *
 * One shared value in sats drives every column on the UI thread, so a roll
 * costs no renders past its first and last. At rest each cell is a single
 * digit; the columns exist only while something moves. A new unit lifts the
 * old cells away and rises the new ones in, hiding scrambles the digits
 * before six dots scale in, and a stale amount turns steam while a dip runs
 * across its cells. Under Reduce Motion every change is a short crossfade.
 *
 * The whole odometer is one element to a screen reader; the cells are hidden.
 * Without an `accessibilityLabel` it reads the amount in sats.
 *
 * The hero sizes itself to fit `room`, the width its container measured,
 * and until it has one the window's width between the page edges. When it
 * steps to another size with the unit unchanged, the figures crossfade over
 * 160ms rather than jump; a new unit brings its cells in at the new size.
