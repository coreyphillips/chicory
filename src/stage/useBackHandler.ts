 *
 * 1. A pane still on its way swallows the press, as a tap would be, rather
 *    than sending the canvas back from somewhere it has not reached.
 * 2. A locked app answers nothing.
 * 3. The innermost scene's own step goes back first (`useSceneBack`), such
 *    as Send's review returning to compose.
 * 4. A payment or a new wallet in flight holds the user where they are, so
 *    the press is swallowed and felt rather than obeyed.
 * 5. An overlay closes, then a scene returns to the one under it.
 * 6. A shell phase closes what it opened (`usePhaseBack`), such as a panel
 *    or an editor.
 * 7. With nothing left to close, the system has the press, which leaves
 *    the app.
 *
 * The scene stack only means something while the canvas is showing. Outside
 * the wallet it can still hold the Settings a network switch will return to,
 * and a press there must not move a canvas nobody can see.
