 * `onCancel` asks for the overlay to close, as Android's back does through
 * the stage.
 *
 * The disc is a circle as wide as twice the distance to the farthest corner,
 * clipping a ground that stays still while it scales from the button's size
 * to 1 on the pane spring. Under Reduce Motion it fades in at full size.
 *
 * Android's camera preview is a SurfaceView, which ignores clipping, alpha

 * beside the disc rather than in it, once the disc has opened, under a cover
 * of the same ground that fades away. Leaving, the camera, which has no exit
 * of its own, is removed at once, and the disc closes like an iris over its
 * still ground while the corners fade. iOS clips a camera fine, and takes the
