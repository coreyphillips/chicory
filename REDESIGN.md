# Chicory redesign

This document is the source of truth for the design of the Chicory app, as redesigned on the `redesign` branch and merged into main: product rules, architecture, tokens, glyphs, the state-to-visual map, choreography, reduced motion and accessibility.

## 1. Product rules

1. **Text lives in Settings.** Outside Settings, visible text is limited to data:

   - amounts and their unit ("sats", "BTC")
   - dates and times
   - recovery words and their numbers
   - request strings, addresses, txids and hashes
   - wallet names and user notes

   Everything else is carried by a glyph, ring, color, motion or haptic. No "Loading...", no hint paragraphs, no text toasts.

2. **Settings-class surfaces may keep short text.** These are Settings itself, restore phrase entry, recovery phrase reveal and backup, first-run network setup, create wallet, and the diagnostics view. They are drawn in the Settings visual language, and their safety lines stay.
3. **Whisper.** Long-pressing a status glyph, ring or disabled control for 400ms shows its accessibility string in a small cocoa pill:

   - Text: cream, 13pt.
   - Entry: scale .92 to 1 with a 160ms fade.
   - Hides after 2400ms.
   - Fires a `tick`.

   This is the only text a user can summon outside Settings.

4. **Safety contract.** Applies to: uncertain or held send, reused receive address, expired request or quote, backup pending, stale balance, and test vs mainnet. Every such state must be:
   - persistent until resolved;
   - encoded three ways: color, a distinct glyph or ring shape, and motion, with a haptic when it starts;
   - enforced by behavior, so the risky action is removed or blocked;
   - announced to screen readers assertively;
   - logged with its full engine message to the diagnostic log, under its code (`SAFETY_CODE` in `src/motion/speech.ts`: HELD, or UNCERTAIN where Send knows the outcome is unknown; STALE; EXPIRED, or QUOTE_EXPIRED for a quote; AMBIGUOUS_RECEIVE_ADDRESS; BACKUP_PENDING; TEST_NETWORK). Settings > Diagnostics colours an entry by its code alone, never by its words: slate for a test network, honey for the other safety states, radish for a failure.
5. **Hold to send.** A payment is committed with a 700ms hold (1000ms when engine warnings exist). Screen readers use a single `activate` action.
6. **Held requests.** A request whose earlier payment is still pending or uncertain cannot be paid again. It lands on the held ring instead of a review. It is held from the moment its hold commits, before the payment's call has answered, and nothing the history shows lets it go until that call does (`src/stage/heldRequests.ts`), nor afterwards through a row older than the attempt: an earlier attempt that failed says nothing about one that may still land. A request is one request however it is copied: it is held under the invoice it carries, bare, with its scheme or inside a Bitcoin link, or else under its address and the amount it names, whatever its label or the order of its parameters. A request whose payment completed is never offered again either: an invoice, or a `bitcoin:` request that names its amount, is paid once, so as soon as this app or the history knows it paid, it lands on its paid mark however it arrives. A failed payment moved no money, and a bare address may rightly be paid again, so neither holds its request. The completion of a request that may be paid again is still kept apart (`completedHere`) until it is paid again, so a held ring that was watching the payment resolves where it stands rather than dropping back to compose.
7. **Haptics are not motion.** Reduce Motion does not switch haptics off. Settings > Haptics does. It is a Keychain preference `com.beignet.wallet.haptics`, on by default.
8. **Money data does not change.** Storage formats, Keychain keys, the engine pins, `useWalletSession`, `useReceiveStatus` and `useAppLock` are untouched. A build from main and a build from this branch open the same wallet on one device.
9. **Prose rules.** No em-dash characters in code, comments, docs, commits or branch names. No attribution trailers in commits.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Stack

- react-native-reanimated 4.7.0, react-native-worklets 0.13.0 and react-native-gesture-handler 3.3.0, all pinned exactly.
- react-native-svg (already present) draws every glyph and shape.
- No Skia, no Lottie, no keyboard controller.
- `react-native-worklets/plugin` is the last Babel plugin.
- `GestureHandlerRootView` wraps the app.
- `InteractionManager` is removed in RN 0.87. Use `afterTransition(fn)` from `src/motion/idle.ts` instead.

### 2.2 Stage model

- **`src/stage/phase.ts`: `derivePhase(input): Phase`.** A pure selector over the session and app lock. It keeps the precedence of the old if/else ladder:

  | Phase     | When                                                               |
  | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `locked`  | the app lock is closed                                             |
  | `transit` | `why` is `erasing`, `closing` or `switching`                       |
  | `opening` | initializing                                                       |
  | `saved`   | no client, a device wallet exists, and device setup is not visible |
  | `welcome` | no client                                                          |
  | `picker`  | a client, but no wallet id                                         |
  | `loading` | a wallet id, no snapshot, no error                                 |
  | `offline` | a wallet id, no snapshot, and an error                             |
  | `wallet`  | a snapshot                                                         |

- **`src/stage/scene.ts`: `stageReducer(state, action)`.**
  - Scenes: `home`, `activity`, `detail`, `send`, `receive`, `settings`.
  - Overlays: `scan` and `create`.
  - The state also carries a back `stack`, a `busy` lock and a `step`.
  - `busy` blocks `back`, `home`, `open`, `link` and `overlay`. `reset` and `tab`, which come from session callbacks, always win.
  - A send scene's prefill lives inside the scene, so leaving it discards the prefill.
- **Android back.** `useBackHandler` runs this chain, and the first rung that answers takes the press:

  1. the transition lock, which swallows the press while a pane moves;
  2. a locked app, which answers nothing;
  3. the innermost scene responder, registered with `useSceneBack(handler, active)` (Send's review back to compose, a lifted QR, an open search); the one that became active last is asked first;
  4. busy, which swallows the press with a warning haptic;
  5. an open overlay, then the scene stack;
  6. the phase responder, registered with `usePhaseBack(handler)` (Welcome's device setup, a network editor);
  7. otherwise the system has the press, and the app is left.

  A handler returns true when it took the press and false to pass it on.

### 2.3 Canvas

- **Two panes.**
  - The top pane is full-height and sits at the back. It holds the status row, the hero, the vessel and the action row, plus the top-slot scenes (send, receive). Home alone is drawn over the sheet while the circle that opened Send or Receive comes home (7, T1).
  - The bottom sheet is full-height and moves only by `translateY` from one `seam` shared value.
- **Seam stops.** `home` = `max(insetTop + 380, 0.5H)`, `compact` = `insetTop + 72` (activity, detail), `gone` = `H + 24` (send, receive).
- **Edge to edge.** The canvas runs under the system bars, so the top pane's gradient reaches the top edge. The insets apply inside it: the status row pads the top inset, the slots start below the status row, Settings starts below the status bar and runs under the home indicator (the inset is room at the end of its page, which fades into roast under its bar), and only a side cutout narrows the canvas itself. The shell phases and the new wallet sheet keep a safe area.
- **Upright.** The canvas is laid out for a phone held upright, so the app is portrait on phones: iOS lists only portrait for iPhone, and Android's main activity asks for portrait (Android 16 ignores that on large screens). Turned sideways, the sheet's resting place would fall below the screen.
- **Panes animate transforms and opacity only**, never flex, height or width.
- **Keyed children with `entering`/`exiting`** give "mount incoming first, unmount outgoing after the fade".
- **Tap lock.** A transition lock blocks taps while a pane moves. A tap takes it in its own tick, before the new scene is drawn. It lifts when the panes look settled, `PANE_SETTLE_MS` (340ms) after the move starts, and 140ms later coming home from Send or Receive, where the action row waits for the scene's content to go (`rowWait`, 7 T1), timed by a clock of its own on the UI thread: the pane spring's rest callback only arrives near 630ms. A safety timeout ends it regardless. A payment's detail card growing out of its row, or folding back, holds the lock too, though the panes stay where the list had them.
- **When a move starts.** The frame that mounts a scene can take 100 to 300ms to paint. So the panes start once the render that shows the new scene has been drawn, in its layout effect, not in the tap's tick: started with the tap they would be most of the way there by the first frame anyone saw. Only a gesture's fling starts at once, at the finger's speed. Every pane, and every entrance and exit preset, runs on a steady clock (3.5), so a long frame later on holds a move back rather than skipping it forward.
- **Settings** slides in from the right over the canvas. The canvas scales to .94 and dims to .5. A swipe in from its left edge (`panes/EdgeBack`, from the first 28pt) moves it with the finger and writes `cover`, so the canvas grows and brightens under it; let go past 40% of the width, or flung faster than 800pt/s, it goes back, and otherwise springs back.
- **Scan** is an overlay. It is a disc that scales up from the scan button, with its content counter-scaled so it stays still. On Android the camera is a SurfaceView, which ignores clipping, alpha and transforms. So the camera mounts only after the reveal finishes, full-bleed, under a cover that then fades out.
  - The canvas draws it above everything while `overlay.name` is `scan`. The panes stay drawn beneath it, out of use, and the canvas under it scales to .96 and dims to .5 on the pane spring (`SCANNING`), springing back as it closes; under Reduce Motion it only dims.
  - A code read from home dispatches `scanned`, and the reducer opens Send prefilled with it. A scan started inside Send has the target `send`: the code goes to the receiver the open Send registered with `useScanReceiver(receiver, active)`, the one that became active last, and the overlay closes over that same Send.
  - Cancelling dispatches `back`, which closes the overlay.
  - Opening and closing the overlay are moves like any other: the canvas under it scales and dims on the pane spring, so each takes the 340ms transition lock. The scanner's close and Android back are refused until it lifts.
- **No `LayoutAnimation`.** Use Reanimated `LinearTransition` on the specific containers that resize.

### 2.4 Contracts that tests depend on

- Keep these export names and prop contracts: `SendScreen`, `ReceiveScreen`, `DetailScreen`, `HomeScreen`, `ActivityScreen`, `SettingsScreen`, `CreateWalletScreen`, `WalletPicker`, `NetworkSettings`, `Scanner`, `AmountField`, `activityStatus`.
- Keep every existing `accessibilityLabel` string wherever its control survives.
- Every visible string that is removed moves verbatim into the `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityValue` or `accessibilityHint` of the glyph that replaces it.
- Controls in panes that are not active expose no `onPress`, and are hidden from accessibility.
- State changes are synchronous. Animation never gates meaning.

## 3. Tokens

- **Soft fills:** bloomSoft #282933, sageSoft #2B3228, honeySoft #3A2F1D, radishSoft #3C231F, creamSoft #3A3632. On a test network slateSoft #2A2829 stands in for bloomSoft, the same 18% step from roast.
- **Washes:** bloomWash #202026, sageWash #22261E, honeyWash #2C2417, radishWash #2E1C18.
- **Arriving glass:** bloom at 35% alpha; on a test network, slate at 35% (`slateGlass`), which the vessel draws at 55% (5, Vessel).
- **Scrim:** rgba(17,14,12,0.88).

**Rules**

- Every meaningful number is at least 7:1.
- Dust never carries a number that matters.
- QR codes are always ink on cream.

**Semantic mapping**

| Meaning      | Color                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Done         | sage                      |
| In flight    | bloom                     |
| Attention    | honey                     |
| Failed       | radish                    |
| Expired      | dust glyph on a husk ring |
| Test network | slate in place of bloom   |

**Legacy aliases in `theme.ts`.** These keep old screens compiling while they are migrated:

| Old name   | New token |
| ---------- | --------- |
| primary    | bloom     |
| mint       | sage      |
| warning    | honey     |
| danger     | radish    |
| background | roast     |
| surface    | espresso  |
| raised     | mocha     |
| overlay    | cocoa     |
| line       | husk      |
| text       | cream     |
| muted      | steam     |
| faint      | dust      |

- **App icon.** The open bloom on roast, under the top pane's glow, drawn by `scripts/app-icon.mjs` from the petal, lengths, centre and colours in `glyphs/Bloom.tsx` and `design/palette.ts`, so it is the flower the app draws. iOS has an opaque icon at every size its icon set names; Android has an adaptive icon (the glow as background, the bloom inside the 66dp safe circle as foreground, and a one-colour bloom for themed icons) and the square and round icons older launchers take. `__tests__/AppIcon.test.ts` checks every size. Run the script again after changing the bloom or the palette.

### 3.2 Gradients (top pane)

| Layer         | Definition                                                                            | Motion                                                                         |

G3 tints:

- **Honey** (backup pending or uncertain): alpha .10 at the mark.
- **Sage flash** (money arrived): alpha .22, 300ms in and 900ms out.
- **Radish** (failure): alpha .14 for 1200ms.
- **Night** (offline receive): #3B4A7A at alpha .10.

**Stale:** G1 and G2 fade to .25. **Test network:** G1 is slate: slate alpha .2, then #2A2C31 alpha .1 at .6, then 0 (`gradients.G1.test`).

### 3.3 Type

- System faces. Every number uses `fontVariant: ['tabular-nums']`.

| Style        | Size / line height         | Weight and details                                                                                                              |

- **Sums.** A sum on screen, Send's review and Receive's quote, sets its operators (`+ ≤`, `≈`, `−`, `=`) in one column as wide as the widest of them at any text size, and its amounts right-aligned after it in tabular figures, so every place lines up and the total reads as the sum of the lines above it. A glyph that leads a line, such as the review's rail, sits in a column of its own before the operators and belongs to that line's element.
- Settings keeps text styles: title 28/34 at 600, body 15/22, label 13/18 at 600.
- `maxFontSizeMultiplier`: hero and amount 1.2, rows 1.4, Settings unlimited. So Settings reflows rather than clips: a label keeps its words whole, taking no more lines than it has words and shrinking a little rather than break one (`wholeWords`); a heading's accessory drops below the heading once the heading, beside it, would need a second line (`accessoryBelow`, measured, not left to Yoga's wrapping); a node address breaks only between its key's groups of 4, after the `@` and before the `:port`, its host and its port each one piece (`nodeAddressText`); its copy control sits beside it while the address's widest piece fits the width the control leaves, and drops below it once that piece needs the whole width, the address shrinking only for a piece wider than the card (`copyFit`, measured); the address is typed in mono as it is shown; no other value breaks inside itself either: a version is one piece (`unbroken`), the app's and the engine's each keeping its words whole on the line they share or on one each, a recovery word shrinks a little rather than break (`wholeWords`), and a diagnostic entry's code breaks only after an underscore (`codeText`); and the glyphs beside the words, the close included, grow with the text up to twice their size (`glyphScale`).

### 3.4 Space and radius

- The spacing scale is unchanged: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 44. The page edge is 24.
- Radius: sm 10, md 14, lg 20, qr 24, pane 28, round 999.
- The minimum touch target is 48 (`MIN_TARGET` in `src/theme.ts`), a control's frame and its hitSlop together. An icon button (`IconButton`) is a 48pt frame. A chip keeps its 38pt pill and reaches 48 up and down through its hitSlop (`CHIP_SLOP`), and is at least 48 wide, so it never reaches sideways into the chip beside it. The corner control is a 48pt target (10.1).

### 3.5 Motion

**Springs** (damping / stiffness / mass):

| Spring | Values         | Used for                                    |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| snap   | 26 / 420 / 0.9 | press, release, keys, chips, ratchet steps  |
| pane   | 30 / 260 / 1   | sheet, shared elements, reveals             |
| reveal | 18 / 180 / 1   | pop-ins, petal unfolds, bursts, check scale |
| soft   | 22 / 120 / 1   | liquid levels, re-saturation                |
| boing  | 10 / 300 / 0.6 | bloom center pops only                      |

**Curves:**

- standard `bezier(.4,0,.2,1)`
- enter `bezier(.05,.7,.1,1)`
- exit `bezier(.3,0,.8,.15)`
- linear for orbits, countdowns and sheen
- sine in-out for breathe and pulse

**Durations (ms):**

| Name      | ms   | Name       | ms                       |
| --------- | ---- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| tick      | 90   | orbit      | 1400 per revolution      |
| exit      | 140  | pulse      | 1800                     |
| enter     | 220  | halo       | 1600                     |
| move      | 320  | sheen      | 2400                     |
| draw      | 420  | shimmer    | 2600                     |
| celebrate | 900  | dashRotate | 8000                     |
| breathe   | 4200 | hold       | 700 (1000 with warnings) |

**Shake:** translateX keyframes 0, -8, 8, -5, 5, -2, 0 at 55ms per step (330ms total).

**Ambient rest.** A loop that only decorates rests once nobody has touched the app for 20s (`AMBIENT_REST_MS` in `src/motion/ambient.ts`), easing to its resting pose, and picks up where it stopped at the next touch or the next change worth seeing. It eases rather than stops: a loop carries on to the end of the cycle it is in, and each of the backdrop's swings to the end it is heading for, where a swing stands still anyway, slowing from its own speed to a stop (`restEase` in `src/motion/loops.ts`), and never turning back. A phone left alone then draws nothing, which spares its battery and lets a tool that waits for a still screen, such as Android's uiautomator, read it.

- **Ambient, and rests:** the backdrop's drift and turn, a bloom's breath and halo (the mark included), the vessel's sheen, seeds and the clock or gauge of a wait, the pulse dot's ping, the backup shield's blink, the rocking moon of a request payable offline, a caret or halo waiting for a press, and the breath of Send's empty well.
- **Meaning, and never rests:** anything that says something is under way: a payment's orbit, a waiting request's dashes, a held outcome's halo, a busy control's spin, a vessel retry, the stale shimmer, the reconnecting pulse, the unplug's drift while a connection is away, Send's waiting clock, the chase and the ratchet while a wallet opens or refreshes, the scanner's reticle, and an expiry ring's last seconds.
- **What wakes it:** any touch under the stage's root, which a capturing responder sees and never takes; the app coming to the front; a new phase, scene or overlay; the balance going stale or fresh; and a read that changes what the wallet shows (`shownBy`: the balance's figures, the vessel's look, the connection and the setup, and each payment's state, built from what is drawn and never from a record's own time, such as the last channelize decision's, which every pass writes again). A read that only lands does not, since one lands every 12s.

**Steady clock.** An animation counts time by the frames' clock, so one long frame moves it that far at once. The canvas's moves, the layout-animation presets in `src/motion/presets.ts`, the pops and the build's beats run on a steady clock instead (`steady` in `src/motion/steady.ts`): each painted frame moves them on by the time since the last, but never more than `FRAME_CAP_MS` (34ms, two frames). At a steady frame rate nothing changes; after a long frame a move carries on from where it was seen.

**Overlap rule:**

- Exits start at t0 and run 140ms on the exit curve, scaling to .98.
- Pane springs start at t0.
- Entering content starts at +80ms and runs 220ms on the enter curve, rising 8 to 16pt.
- Siblings stagger 25 to 40ms.
- Total perceived time stays under 350ms.

### 3.6 Haptics

Semantic names are defined in `src/design/haptics.ts` on top of `services/haptics.ts`:

## 4. Glyphs

- **Grid.** 24 viewBox, 2pt padding, round caps and joins.
- **Stroke width by render size:** 16 is 2.0, 20 is 1.8, 24 is 1.7, 32 is 1.5, 48 and up is 1.3.
- **No fills**, except 1-unit dots and the bloom.
- **Color** comes only from semantic tokens.
- **Existing glyphs.**
  - Kept: check, close, copy, scan, search, lock, key, shield, eye, eyeOff, refresh, bolt, clock, share, plus.
  - Renamed: arrowUp is now `send`, arrowDown is `receive`, link is `chain`.
  - Settings only: alert, info, back, chevron, chevronDown, wallet.
- **New paths:**

| Glyph       | Path                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## 5. Signature components

### Bloom (`src/glyphs/Bloom.tsx`)

- **Geometry.** A 100 viewBox centered at 50,50 with 12 petals at 30i degrees.
  - Angle jitter: +2 degrees on odd i; -1.5 degrees when i%3 is 0.
  - Petal lengths, in order: 1, .96, .99, .94, 1, .97, .95, 1, .98, .95, .99, .96.
- **Petal path** (pointing up): `M-1.6,-8 C-4.2,-18 -9.8,-31 -10.4,-41.5 L-8.3,-44.8 L-6.25,-42.6 L-4.2,-45.6 L-2.1,-43.3 L0,-46 L2.1,-43.3 L4.2,-45.6 L6.25,-42.6 L8.3,-44.8 L10.4,-41.5 C9.8,-31 4.2,-18 1.6,-8 Z`.
  - Below 40pt, use the three-tooth tip: `L-6.9,-45 L-3.5,-42.6 L0,-45.8 L3.5,-42.6 L6.9,-45 L10.4,-41.5`.
- **Fill.** A userSpace gradient from y -8 to -46: bloomNight, bloomDeep at .45, bloomHi.
- **Vein.** `M0,-12 L0,-38`, bloomNight at .35 alpha, width .8. Full detail only.
- **Center.** Circle r7.5 in stamen, with 8 anthers (r1.1) at radius 9.5 and 5 pollen dots (r.9) at radius 5. At mark size the center is a plain circle, r8.
- **Tones.**
  - live: gradient fill
  - test: slate outline, stroke 1.6
  - dormant: husk and bark
  - honey: the halo ring only
- **Petal state q, from 0 to 1.** Each petal's q is a reveal spring that fires when progress crosses i/12.
  - scaleX: .18 + .82q
  - scaleY: (.25 + .75q) × length
  - rotate: theta - 14(1-q)
  - opacity: .25 + .75q
- **Modes.**
  - **Breathe:** the wrapper scales to 1.035 and rotates 1.5 degrees over 4200ms, sine.
  - **Center breathe:** the petals hold still and the center alone swells to 1.25 and back over 4200ms, sine (setup pending).
  - **Chase:** petal opacity is .35 + .65 × max(0, 1 - ((head - i) mod 12) / 4), with head running 0 to 12 over 1320ms, linear.
  - **Ratchet:** +30 degrees every 600ms (snap spring).
  - **Burst:** q goes to 1.12; a clone scales to 1.6 and fades over 700ms; the center pops 1.3 (boing).
  - **Wilt:** petals rotate +10 degrees and shrink to .92 length, crossfade to dust, and the wrapper shakes.
  - **Fold:** q runs in reverse, 40ms apart.
  - **Fall:** petals drop 48pt, rotate plus or minus 25 degrees and fade, 60ms apart.
- **Performance.** Petals are `Animated.View`s wrapping static SVG. Loops animate transform and opacity only.

### Odometer (`src/glyphs/Odometer.tsx`)

- **Cells.**
  - Each cell is a clipped column holding "0..9,0".
  - A cell is exactly one line box of its figures tall, its line height in whole pixels rounded up, as Android sets a line (`cellHeight`), and the figures carry no font padding (`includeFontPadding: false`, `textAlignVertical: 'center'`), so nothing of the digits above and below shows in it.
  - Cells are keyed by place value from the right.
  - Separator cells are .30em wide.
  - BTC always shows 8 decimals, with trailing zeros in dust.
- **Rolling.** A shared value v (in sats) animates over clamp(280 + 140 × log10(|delta| + 1), 280, 1100)ms on the standard curve. For place k:
  - u = 10^k
  - whole = floor(v / u)
  - rem = v - whole × u
  - pos = whole % 10 + rem when k is 0. Otherwise pos = whole % 10 + smoothstep(clamp(rem - (u - 1), 0, 1)).
  - So a place turns only while the ones roll from 9 to 0, in step with every place between, as a mechanical counter carries: a figure mid-roll reads the amount it has reached or the next one up, and 59,877 never reads 69,877.
  - A column that would pass more than half a row a frame, on average across the roll, shows whole rows instead (`snapBelow`): at that speed a slide is never seen, and a frame caught it half out of its cell, a digit set high or low.
  - translateY = -pos × cell height.
  - A rolling column is two layers, its even rows and its odd rows, since a cell shows at most one row of each. Each layer fades by its one row in view, 1 - smoothstep(|row - pos|), so a digit fades as it slides over the cell's edge and the two in view always add to one. A scramble lands on whole rows, so each jump shows one digit whole.
  - A place above the amount's highest digit is blank, never 0, beyond the places always drawn (the ones in sats, every place to the whole coin in BTC; `leadingZero`), so a figure mid-roll never reads "065,446" or "+0,888". Its cell, and the separator after it, are shut while it is blank and open as its digit rolls up from blank, fully by the time half of it shows (`placeInk`, `cellOpen`), frame by frame with the roll on the UI thread. So a count up from 0 grows its places as it reaches them, a separator shows only with the place before it, the sign keeps to the first digit, and one going away rolls down to blank before its cell leaves. No cell has an entrance of its own in a roll or slides on a layout transition, so no two figures are ever drawn in one cell.
- **Unit swap.** The outgoing cells lift and fade (140ms, 12ms apart). The incoming cells rise with the snap spring.
- **Mask.** Each digit jumps 4 times at 40ms, then crossfades to a 6-dot mask (scale in with snap, 20ms apart).
- **Stale.** The color moves to steam, and each cell dips in opacity to .65 in turn, 60ms apart, repeating every 2600ms.
- **Accessibility.** The whole odometer is one element; the cells are hidden from assistive tech.

### Vessel

- **Shape.** A pill under the hero. It is a 2pt cream hairline at .25 alpha when everything is spendable, and swells to 8pt when money is in flight or out of reach.
- **Segments,** left to right:
  - Out of reach: stripes at 45 degrees over a faint wash, from the left end. While the primary is not connected they are honey, with a honey `unplug` on that end whose halves drift while it lasts (4, unplug; it never rests, 3.5). With the primary connected they are dust and carry no glyph (`reach: 'held'`): the totals cannot tell a peer that is away from the reserve of a large channel the wallet holds little of (1% of a 1,000,000 sat channel is half of 20,000 held in it), so the vessel shows the share and never says a channel is away. It is the Lightning money that can be neither sent now nor is on its way (`unreachableSats` in `scenes/home/visual.ts`: the total less what can be sent and what is arriving), as when the peer of a channel holding it is away. A channel reserve is never drawn: the gap counts only past 2% of the total plus 1,000 sats (`RESERVE_SHARE`, `RESERVE_FLOOR_SATS`), which the reserve CLN and LND keep, 1% of a channel and never under the 546 sat dust limit, cannot reach; the device measured reserves of 1.1% and 1.85%, and a peer away as 77% and 100%. The stripes are 4pt apart across them, 1.5pt wide, and drawn as whole lines across the art (`hatchPath` in `glyphs/Vessel`), never as a pattern tile turned 45 degrees, which iOS drew as a speck in each tile's corner. They hold still while their clip grows or shrinks, so they never stretch. Every part of the pill's art, the stripes, the sheen and the still hatch, is drawn at the open pill's height and clipped by the pill (`ART_HEIGHT`), so it fills the pill at whatever height the pill is passing through.
  - Available: solid bloom.
  - Arriving: bloom glass at .35 alpha, with a cream sheen, .55 at its middle, that sweeps across every 2400ms.
  - On a test network slate stands in for bloom in both, and in a bloom glyph, and the glass is slate at .55, since at .35 it read as an empty grey track. Honey, radish, sage and dust stay.
- **Glyphs on its ends.** A glyph sits just past an end of the pill, 6pt from it, on the pill's middle line, in the room the vessel's inset leaves: the one that names a wait on the right end, by the glass, and the unplug on the left end, by what is out of reach.
- **Styles, chosen from `snapshot.wallet.lfbw`:**

  | Source                                      | Look                                          |
  | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | wait/below-floor (under 25,000 sats)        | dust "seeds" that bob 1pt                     |
  | splice-in, open, open-v2                    | glass plus a `sprout`                         |
  | wait/fee-too-high                           | honey glass, no sheen, plus a honey `gauge`   |
  | failed                                      | radish glass plus `refresh` with a retry ring |
  | wait/splicing, channel-pending, unconfirmed | slow sheen plus `clock`                       |
  | lastSplice conflicted                       | reversed honey sheen plus `rewind`            |
  | lastSplice reverted                         | sage wash plus `rewind`                       |
  | unpairedFunding                             | `inflow`                                      |

- **Channelize.** When funds move into the channel, the solid segment grows with the soft spring and a cream ripple runs along the seam.
- **Tap.** The vessel expands to 28pt and shows both numbers for 3s.
- **Words.** The label reads the split, and the money out of reach after it ("{a} sats ready to send, {p} sats arriving, {u} sats out of reach"). The value names what is out of reach (`copy.home.outOfReach` while the primary is away, `copy.home.heldBack` otherwise), then why the money waits, one phrase for each look above and "On its way." for plain glass, and a long press on each glyph whispers its phrase. A hidden balance names neither.

### PulseDot

- **Shape.** A 7pt dot at the mark's bottom right.
- **States.**
  - sage: pings on each successful poll (scale to 2.6, fade, 900ms), but not while decoration rests (3.5)
  - honey: pulses 1 to 1.3 every 1800ms while reconnecting
  - hollow radish: refresh failed

### StatusRing (40 / 96 / 120pt)

- **Layers:** track, progress arc, orbit, halo, glyph slot.
- **Transitions:**

  | To        | What happens                                                                              |
  | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | completed | progress fills to 1 over 360ms; the check draws starting at +120ms; the ring pops to 1.08 |
  | failed    | turns radish, shakes, draws a cross                                                       |
  | uncertain | steady honey with the halo looping, plus `pause`                                          |
  | expired   | the stroke becomes dashed (3 5) and fades to .55                                          |

### CopyChip

- **Look.** A mocha pill holding the value in mono, shortened in the middle and grouped in fours, with a `copy` glyph. A URI's scheme and the human-readable part of an address or invoice up to its `1` (`bitcoin:`, `bcrt1`, `lnbcrt30u1`) stay whole, and what follows them is grouped (`chipLead`).
- **Tap.** A tick, then `copy` morphs into a sage check while a cream wash sweeps across (180ms in, 700ms hold, 600ms out). Screen readers hear "{Label} copied".
- **Long press.** Expands to show the full value.
- **Record.** A chip that is not `copyable` shows its value in steam and copies nothing, and carries no `copy`; a screen reader hears its label and the value. A payment's detail draws its request string as a chip, which copies while the request can be paid and is only the record once it cannot.
- **Kind glyphs.** A payment's detail leads every chip with a glyph for what it holds, outside the chip as its lines do, in the lines' 20pt column at the detail's edge (`qr` for the request string, or `bolt` for an old Lightning invoice, `hash` for the reference, `chain` for the transaction, `bolt` for the payment hash, `pin` for the address), and a chip that copies carries `copy`, so what shows a value copies is always the same glyph.
- **Shape.** A pill round its value and glyph, at least 48pt tall and rounded by half that, which hugs its value wherever it sits rather than stretching across its row.

### HoldButton

- **Look.** An 88pt circle with a 4pt ring and a `send` glyph.
- **Press in.** Scales to .94. The fill runs over 700ms on `bezier(.35,0,.25,1)`, with ramp haptics.
- **Complete.** A thud, a cream flash, a pop to 1.06, then the arrow launches and 12 petal sparks burst. What the commit ends fades as the flash rises (`commit`, a shared value the caller passes and the hold runs to 1 over a tick), as the quote's ring does.
- **Released early.** The fill drains with the snap spring.
- **Timing.** The hold is a long press the gesture handler times on the UI thread, where the fill runs (`useLongPressGesture` with worklet callbacks, handing back with `scheduleOnRN`): the complete plays as the ring fills however busy the JavaScript thread is, and a finger lifted after that cannot take it back. Tests read its duration with `holdMs(tree, label)` in `test-support/query`.
- **With warnings.** The fill is honey and takes 1000ms.
- **Accessibility.** An `activate` action sends immediately. VoiceOver's double tap reaches it as an accessibility tap, which commits the same way, since iOS lists `activate` only among the custom actions. One action pays, so the hold's value says everything a sighted payer sees before holding (on a review: the total, the fee cap, the expected fee and every engine warning), and a screen reader is never moved onto the hold itself.

### ExpiryRing

- **Shape.** An outer ring at r+8, stroke 2.5, in bloom. It depletes linearly over `expiresAt - now` using a single `withTiming`.
- **Late states.** At 10s or less it turns honey; at 3s or less it pulses.
- **Expired.** The stroke collapses to 0, and the arrow rotates -135 degrees while `refresh` draws in.
- **Spent.** Once the hold commits, the quote is used: its ring fades out with the commit, over a tick as the flash rises, driven from the UI thread with the hold (HoldButton's `commit`) rather than by the payment's render, which a busy JavaScript thread held back 600ms while the ring ran on beside the new orbit; and for the rest of that payment nothing expires, turns honey or offers a refresh, whatever its clock or the balance's age says. Only the engine refusing the quote as it is sent (`QUOTE_EXPIRED`) brings the refresh back, since nothing went out.
- **Request frames.** The same ring runs around the QR frame's perimeter, and turns honey in the request's last tenth or last minute, whichever is longer.

### QrBloom

- **Modules.** Built with `require('qrcode').create(uri, {errorCorrectionLevel: 'M'}).modules`, split into 5 bands by distance from the center, plus the finder squares.
- **Fit.** The modules fill the card but for a quiet zone of four modules, a little more on the densest codes so the card's rounded corner stays a module clear of each finder (`qrGrid`). Every module edge falls on a whole pixel, so bands meet without a seam and a dense unified request still scans, inline and lifted alike.
- **Reveal.** The card scales .92 to 1. Starting at t80, band k enters at 40k ms. The finder squares pop last.
- **Worked out after the card.** A dense request's modules and bands take a frame or more to work out, so they are worked out once the card has first drawn (`useQrDrawing`), in one pass over the grid, rather than in the render that changes the step: the step switches and the card arrives first. A card that waited for its drawing gives up only the t80 lead-in (`bloomMotion`), never the bands' stagger.
- **Dissolve.**
  - Expired: outer bands go first.
  - Paid: the finders go at once and the bands from the centre out, 40ms apart, each imploding to .2 as it fades and all gone by 420ms (`QR_CARD_GONE`). Meanwhile the cream card, opaque all the way down, contracts and rounds into the receipt's 120pt mark at its centre (`lands`, `paidCard`), then hands over to it over 90ms, so nothing of the code lingers and it never fades as a flat card.
- **Enlarge.** A shared transition to full width. The lifted code is modal to a screen reader: the step under it is hidden, focus moves to its close control, the escape gesture sets it down, and focus goes back to the code.

### Received celebration

| Time (ms) | What happens                                                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | incoming haptic; the QR implodes as its card contracts onto the mark (420ms) |
| 200       | the amount counts up (700ms)                                                 |
| 420       | the card has landed; the sage ring draws round the mark (480ms)              |
| 600       | the check draws (420ms)                                                      |
| 700       | the petal burst (800ms) and the sage tint                                    |

The mark is Send's result's size (`RECEIPT_MARK`, 120pt) at the code's centre. Done, it is Send's done disc, cream with a 56pt ink check, rimmed in sage, with the amount under it at 48pt in sage; confirming or part paid, a husk track with the sage orbit or the split arc. It is drawn under the code, whose card lands on it, and its rim and husk track wait for the card to go (`QR_CARD_GONE`), so no dark ring cuts across the code as it implodes.

Under the done mark the way to the payment list is the history glyph (`HISTORY_GLYPH`, `restore`), as under Send's results (6, Send).

On-chain but not yet confirmed: the sequence stops at a sage orbit.

On the canvas a payment that completes is felt once, by the canvas's `useIncoming` as the wallet reads it, so Receive plays neither the incoming haptic nor a success for it. Receive plays the incoming haptic itself only for money it sees before the wallet's history shows it arrived: on chain but unconfirmed, or part of what was asked.

### Keypad

- **Layout.** 1 to 9, blank, 0, backspace.
- **Press.** A mocha disc springs in behind the key (snap) with a tick. It always springs back as the finger lifts, even from a key that went idle under it, as backspace does once holding it clears the amount.
- **Digits.** A new digit rises 12pt as it enters. A removed digit starts faint, at .3, and drops 8pt as it fades, gone within half a tick, since the unit takes its place at once: started whole, it was seen over the unit. Under Reduce Motion it only fades, as faint and as fast. The amount moves as one: its figures, separators, unit and marks are laid out afresh at once, so a comma moves with the digits it groups and the unit is out of the way before a new digit shows, and only the row as a whole eases, as `smooth` moves a step, to where its new width centres it. It eases from where it stood, but never from further along than keeps it inside its field (`rowMove` in `scenes/keypad/AmountReadout`, `easeFrom` in `scenes/keypad/fit`): laid out afresh from where the narrower row stood, a long amount went past the field's right edge before it eased back, cutting off its unit or its disc for up to 8 frames (P14).
- **Fit.** The row fits its field whole: a long amount steps its figures down a size at a time, 48 to 40, 32, 26, 20 and 16 with the line in step (`amountSize` in `scenes/keypad/fit`), until the figures, the unit, any mark and a shake's 8pt either side fit the width the field measures, so a refused 999,999,999 and its disc are never cut off, at rest, shaking or on the way to where a new digit centres it. The unit and the marks keep their size.
- **Clear.** Long-pressing backspace for 450ms clears the amount, with a rigid haptic. A screen reader has it as backspace's `longpress` action, labelled `copy.keypad.clear` ("Clear the amount").
- **Limits.** The glyph that names a limit is a state glyph: 20pt on a 32pt disc in its tone's soft fill (honeySoft, radishSoft, mocha for dust), after the unit and centred on the amount's line, so it never reads as a stray mark of punctuation. It pops in with the tone, and its own motion plays on the disc.
  - Over what can be spent now, but covered by money on its way: honey, with a `clock`.
  - Over what can be spent now with nothing arriving that would cover it (the gap is the channel reserve, say), over the total, or over the offline cap: radish, and it shakes once. A screen reader hears how much can be sent now, or that the wallet holds less.
  - More than 16 digits: the key is refused. The amount flashes radish and shakes, with a rigid haptic, and a screen reader hears `copy.keypad.refused`.

### Scan reveal

- **Disc.** Its diameter is 2 × the distance from the button to the farthest corner, and it scales up from the button size with the pane spring. The spring, and the clock that mounts the camera once the disc looks open, run on the steady clock (3.5), so the slow frame that mounts the overlay holds the reveal back rather than skipping it.
- **Reticle.** Four 28pt corners fly in, 40ms apart, on the steady clock too.
- **Test network.** The ground and the camera's cover are slate's night in place of bloom's, a deep step from roast toward slate (`SLATE_NIGHT`, the step the canvas's own test glow takes), so it reads as a night and not as a grey fog round a black middle, and a slate `flask` sits at the page edge in the status row's band, which the scan covers (rule 4). The canvas passes the wallet's network, and so does a Send that draws its camera itself.
- **System prompts.** The camera is asked for as the scan opens (on iOS through camera-kit, before the camera mounts, when it has never been asked; on Android at runtime), and a paste reads the clipboard, each inside `duringSystemPrompt`, so the privacy cover leaves the scan in place behind the prompt. A payment's detail reads the clipboard the same way.
- **Valid code.** The corners snap to .85 and turn sage.
- **Invalid code.** A radish flash and a shake, and scanning continues.
- **Denied or no camera.** `cameraOff`, `clipboard`, and on denial a `cog` that opens OS settings.

### Whisper

A cocoa pill anchored above its source (see rule 3), kept inside the page edge (24), its lines balanced so a last word is never left alone on its own line.

Drawn edge to edge where the canvas draws each part (`HOME`, `heroBox`, `stops` and `STATUS_ROW` in `stage/layout`): the mark and the name in the status row, a pending backup's tile beside them, the lock where the corner control stands, the dots in the balance's box, the vessel's hairline, the three husk circles in the action row, and the sheet at its home stop.

| app switcher        | In the background, or inactive, and not locked, a roast ground covers everything (with the 96pt mark in the network's tone on Android; plain on iOS, matching the native cover below), so the switcher's picture holds no balance. Behind a system prompt the app raised (paste, camera; `duringSystemPrompt`), inactive leaves the screen in place. Once up, it stays up until the app is active again: no later step on the way out or back lowers it, a prompt's window or a state the app cannot name included (`coverAfter`). Up and down at once, the mark's petals too. The lock hides the wallet itself, its bud in view while a biometric prompt makes the app inactive. |
| offline             | A dormant mark with a hollow radish dot, `unplug`, a 64pt `refresh` (Retry connection), a 56pt `boltRetry` (Retry wallet setup, with a honey pip when there is a setupError), and a `cog`. The cog opens the setup panel (the network editor and the recovery phrase) with `swap` (Choose another wallet) and `lock` under it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**The native cover.** The picture the iOS app switcher keeps is taken once the app is in the background, and the stage's cover reaches it only if JavaScript is free to draw in time. So the app delegate puts a plain roast view over the window in `applicationDidEnterBackground` itself, above the root view and at once, and `applicationDidBecomeActive` takes it away: the kept picture is plain roast however busy JavaScript is, and the stage's cover under it is plain on iOS too, so the way back reads as one ground rather than stepping to the mark. Nothing native goes up as the app merely turns inactive. A prompt the app raised does that too, and the screen stays behind those, and an app-to-app switch (another app opened by a link, a notification or the system) animates the outgoing card from a picture iOS takes before the app is told it is leaving. The device showed it for about 200ms, a cover put up in `applicationWillResignActive` made no difference, and none can reach it (P16); it shows what was on screen a moment before, and the picture that is kept is covered.

**Android recents.** Android has no inactive step to catch, and takes its picture for Recents as the app leaves. From Android 13 (API 33) the main activity turns that picture off (`setRecentsScreenshotEnabled(false)` in `onCreate`), so the app's card in Recents is blank. It never sets `FLAG_SECURE`, which would block the person's own screenshots as well.

| reconnecting        | The PulseDot is honey and pulses.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| stale (45s or more) | The hero goes steam with the shimmer wave; the glow drops to .25; the actions turn dust and scale to .94. Tapping one shakes it, fires a warning haptic, and starts a manual refresh.                                                 |
| cached launch       | The stale look plus a ratcheting mark. The first live read re-saturates it and fires a sage ping. Its warning waits for that read: once it is 15s overdue, the stale signal plays.                                                    |

| manual refresh      | The mark ratchets. Pulling down on the top pane opens the petals as you pull: Home's own pan writes `pull`, and the mark folds, then opens a petal each twelfth of the way, whole at the trigger.                                     |
| hidden              | 6-dot masks everywhere, toggled by long-pressing the hero. A payment's review is the one exception: it always shows its amounts, since it is where the payment is checked before it is sent.                                          |
| unit                | Tapping the hero rolls between sats and BTC.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| test network        | Slate replaces bloom everywhere, with a `flask` micro-glyph. An old balance on a test network keeps the mark's slate outline, where on mainnet the mark goes dormant; the hero, the actions and the dot still say the balance is old. |

Home's safety states, an old balance, a backup to save and a test network, are each felt and logged once as it begins (`signalStep` in `scenes/home/signals`), and not again while it lasts. Not when Home is drawn anew, after a relock or a spell offline: the stage keeps what the open wallet has felt (`StageStore.felt`), and forgets it once no wallet is open, so a wallet opened again feels its own. Not when the app comes back either. One that begins while the app is away, or as it leaves, is felt once the app is in front again, if it still holds, and never as it leaves; an old balance also waits while Send or Receive, which warn about it themselves, is in front. Send's gate feels, logs and says it, so Send marks it felt for the wallet as its gate closes, and Home, back in front while it still holds, does not feel it a second time. Receive only says it, so Home feels it once Receive goes. Felt is not heard, though: a state whose words were withdrawn before they were said, because Send went first or a Home was torn down by a relock, is said by Home once it is in front and the state still holds, without being felt or logged again (`heardSince` in `motion/speech`, `felt.since` on the stage).

### Activity row (64pt)

- **Layout.**
  - Left: a StatusRing (40pt) with the kind glyph.
  - Middle: the amount, with the note underneath.
  - Right: the time above the rail glyph.
- **Rail glyph.**
  - `bolt`: Lightning. The id starts `payment:`, or the method is lightning.
  - `chain`: on-chain.
  - `fund`: direct funding.
- **Title.** The engine's title only goes into the accessibility label.
- **Amount styles.**
  - received: sage, 600, "+"
  - sent: cream, 400, "-"
  - request: steam, with the infinity glyph when the amount is open
  - transfer: cream, no sign
  - failed or expired: dust, struck through
  - In BTC a row, and a detail's lines, draw all eight decimals as the hero does, the zeros after the last significant one in dust, and all eight for no amount or a whole bitcoin (`figureOf`).
- **Rings.**

- **Attention shelf.** Pinned first: the backup tile, then uncertain items, then partial ones.
- **Filters.** Glyph chips: send, receive, qr, orbit. Tapping the active chip again clears it. `search` expands into a field.
- **Empty.** A dormant bud outline that breathes.
- **A payment's detail.** One focal point: the 96pt ring and the 40pt amount in the header. Under them, lines led by a glyph in a 20pt column, each read as text: the date, the fee (money sent or moved always has one; money that came in only when the engine says it cost something), the note. A paid request's receipt adds only what the header cannot say, as lines (`ReceiveReceipt` `bare`): what arrived over what was asked while part of it has, and each Bitcoin transaction with its own ring in the glyph column. The request itself follows as a line (its code above it while it can still be paid), then how it could be paid, a line of rail glyphs, then the reference chips.

| compose                 | A request well with 44pt `clipboard` and `scan` glyphs, bare on the well's ground, and a breathing dashed border. A request is read as it is pasted, scanned, linked or typed and left: one the parser refuses never becomes a chip, and stays in the well with its `cross`, felt, said and logged, shortened in the middle as a chip shows it, on a line or two, until the well is touched to change it. A paste is read inside `duringSystemPrompt` (`src/stage/systemPrompt.ts`), so Send stays in view behind the system's paste prompt, and what it brings, a chip or a refusal's `cross` and haptic, lands once the app is in front again.

| sending, past its grace | The call has not answered: the stage lets go, so Close works, and the screen moves to the held ring with an orbit running just inside it (the held state below: tint, `held` haptic, assertive announcement, logged under HELD). The call goes on; its answer is recorded in the held set whether or not Send is still open. If the ring is still showing, a completed payment resolves it where it stands into the done disc, as a held request re-entered does (below), with the one amount under it turning cream: nothing is laid out afresh, so the mark never jumps and two amounts are never drawn together (P14, 05h). An unknown or failed answer moves the ring on to its own result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| held request re-entered | Goes straight to the held ring, with an orbit running just inside it while its payment is still under way: cream at .6 on a 3pt track of its own, 4pt in from the ring (`HELD_ORBIT` in `scenes/send/ResultMark`), since a honey orbit on the honey ring could not be seen, and a payment going out looked like one whose outcome is unknown. The history glyph under it opens the payment once the history shows it, and the history until then. If its payment completes while the ring shows, whether this app's call or the history says so and whether the request is paid once or may be paid again, the ring resolves into the done disc (`resolves`): the ring fades as the disc grows out of its inside and the check draws. The disc is drawn over the ring, which keeps its place under it until it has faded, so its pause and orbit never show on the disc (P14, 05r). It is heard as sent rather than already paid: it is the news the ring was waiting for, so it is felt once, as a success (`resolved`), which takes the place of the held haptic's second warning if that is still to play, so no warning follows it, and it returns home after 2200ms as a completed result does, unless a screen reader is running or it is touched or takes focus. |
| paid request re-entered | The completed mark at rest: the cream disc with its check already drawn, no pop, no haptic and no celebration, the amount in cream, and no return home.

**The amount step.** `pencil` (a note) and `moon` (offline, when offered) sit either side of the amount's cue, in a row of three whose sides share its width, so the cue stays centred without the moon; the pencil is a bare glyph as the cue is, not a disc, and turns bloom while the note is open. Then the amount and its presets. Continue is pinned at the bottom of the step, above the bottom inset, with a refusal's pip beside it as Send has it, so a refusal is never pushed off screen. A refusal Receive knows is said in its own words, its amounts formatted as amounts (`receiveRefusal`: the primary's cap on one receive becomes "funds at most 1,000,000 sats"), while the diagnostic log keeps the engine's; one that refuses the amount itself also turns the amount radish (the table's amount refused). In the scene the step measures its slot (`ReceiveHost.room`) and fits it: what is entered scrolls on a short phone, and the way on stays in view. Every step keeps its way on in one row at its foot (`CONTROL_ROW`, as tall as the quote's ring): Continue, the quote's create or refresh, and the request's controls sit at one height above the bottom inset, as Send's control does, each with a refusal beside it, so the thumb stays put from step to step. Held back, Continue is drawn at full size, as Send's review is, so the circle that lands on it never lands on a smaller control that then grows. Continue's row holds still as the step arrives, as Send's does, since Home's circle is landing on it (7, T2), and Continue is measured again whenever the row moves, as it does when the step is fitted to its slot.

On a test network Receive draws slate wherever it would draw bloom (`scenes/receive/tone.ts`): its glyphs, the busy orbit, the halo, the offline switch, the primary controls and the burst petals, and `ReceiveRequestDetails` does the same for the request a payment's detail keeps when it is given `test`. The quote's and the request's expiry rings take the test network too, so their calm stroke is slate.

### Backup and setup

- **Backup pending.** A honey halo on the mark and a shield tile in the shelf. It cannot be dismissed, and tapping it opens Settings > Recovery phrase.
- **Test network.** The setup surfaces draw in slate where they would draw bloom on a test network, as Settings does (`SettingsNetwork`): the new wallet sheet by the network it makes the wallet on, a phase's `SetupPanel` by the active profile's network (the wallet's, offline), and `BackupPanel` by the wallet's.
- **Backup pending over a shell phase.** Loading, offline and the picker have no mark and no Settings, so the stage draws the same shield tile at the top of the phase, with no words. Tapping it opens the recovery phrase in a setup surface of its own (`stage/layers/BackupPanel`), drawn in place of the phase. It stays open across a change of phase, the wallet opening included, so a phrase being written down is never taken away. Its close control and Android back let it go, and saving the phrase ends the backup, which closes it.
- **Reveal (Settings).** With the app lock on, a biometric prompt (`requireUnlock`), then the words rise in order. The prompt is one the app raised (`duringSystemPrompt` in `src/stage/systemPrompt.ts`), as are the lock's own prompt when Settings turns it on and the one before an erase, so the privacy cover can leave Settings in view behind Face ID. With the lock off the deliberate reveal is the only gate: the prompt reads the lock's own Keychain item, which exists only while the lock is on, and rule 8 keeps the lock and its Keychain items as they are.
- **Confirming saved.** A 900ms hold that turns honey to sage. The halo then shrinks into the mark.
- **Restore entry.** Each word lights a petal. From word 13 a second ring lights. More than 24 words turns it radish and shakes. At 12 or 24 the center pops and the control enables.

A background read of the wallet is not something the person did, so it earns no glyph of its own: when it keeps failing, the canvas keeps the last figures and draws them as old (the stale look). Its reason is written to the diagnostic log as `REFRESH_FAILED`, once for each reason (`useRefreshFailures` in `stage/Stage`), so Settings > Diagnostics lists it among the app's recent errors, in the engine's own words.

## 7. Choreography (ms from the tap)

**T1, Home to Send** (T2, Receive, mirrors it with the receive circle, which grows into Receive's own 88pt control):

| Time       | What happens                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | tap haptic                                                                                                                                               |
| 0 to 300   | the sheet slides off the bottom; rows fade out by 140                                                                                                    |
| 0 to 65    | scan and receive fade, gone a frame before the content enters (`OTHERS_GONE` in `scenes/home/motion`), so they are never drawn over it; shrinking to .8  |
| 0 to 140   | the vessel fades; the cog spins out                                                                                                                      |
| 0 to 320   | the hero shrinks to the mini strip (scale .34), showing what can be spent, swapped in place; the tapped circle moves to bottom center and grows 56 to 88 |
| about 310  | the circle is on the scene's own control, looking as it does, and fades under it over 140ms                                                              |
| 80         | the close control spins in                                                                                                                               |
| 80 to 300  | the well rises 12pt                                                                                                                                      |
| 120 to 360 | keypad rows enter, 30ms apart                                                                                                                            |

Going back reverses it: content exits in 140ms, the springs reverse, and rows re-enter 25ms apart. The action row waits for the content to go (`rowWait` in `stage/panes/usePaneMotion`, 140ms, the lock held that much longer), so no circle grows over what the scene still draws, such as a result's mark; meanwhile the tapped circle comes back up where it landed. Then the three rise and land on the row together. Where it landed is near the foot of the screen, which the sheet rises over on its way home, so until the row is back Home is drawn over the sheet and what the scene leaves (the canvas's `rising`, and by `RISEN_BY` at the latest): the two never overlap at rest, so only the circle is seen over the sheet, and it is never hidden behind it. The content leaves inside the top slot: the canvas keeps the scene drawn where it was, with what it last showed and out of use, and fades it with a style of the slot's own before letting it go (`SceneLeave` in `stage/panes/Leaving`), never with a layout exit, which on the device drew it over the rising sheet and the growing hero. As it starts to leave, the circle is handed back (`Launched`).

The tapped circle is one element with the scene's control: it lands on the slot's bottom centre (`launchLanding` in `stage/layout`), or on the control itself once the scene measures it (`useLaunchLanding` in `stage/panes/Launch`: read in the window as it is laid out and again each frame, the landing following it, until two readings agree, so an entrance that still moves the control never sends the circle where it was on its way in), whole all the way, and only then fades under it (`handover`). Send's review control and Receive's Continue are each held in a view that measures them, so the circle lands where the device draws them, and each is drawn inside that view under the hand-over's `style`, so it stays unseen until the circle hands over and the two are never seen apart. It travels on `launchTravel` (`scenes/home/motion`), a smoothstep of the pane spring's progress, so it is on the control, within half a point, about 310ms after the panes set out rather than on the spring's long tail, and coming home it lands as the other two settle. It hands over when Home sees it there (`landedAt`), never on a clock: the canvas's `HANDOVER_LATEST` only stands in for an arrival that never came, and under Reduce Motion the hand-over is at once. On the way it takes on the look of the control it becomes (`launchLook` in `stage/layout`, as the scene opens: Send's review live when the request it opens on can be paid and names its amount (`reviewOpensLive` in `scenes/send/model`, the rule the review itself draws by), Receive's Continue live when an empty amount can be asked for, each otherwise held back in dust), the control's fill and ring fading in over its own and its glyph turning to the control's colour and size, so it hands over to its twin. Its glyph is the control's all the way: drawn once at the size it lands at, with the control's stroke, and shrunk inside the circle as it sets out (`glyphScale` in `scenes/home/motion`), so on screen it grows from its 24pt at home to the control's in step with the circle, and its line keeps the control's weight for its size (4, stroke width by size). Nothing is enlarged, which on the device drew a soft line half again as heavy that thinned as it handed over, and no stroke is animated, which the device never drew. A request that is held or already paid opens on the held ring or its paid mark (rule 6), which draw no control, so the circle has nowhere to land: settled as the scene opens (`heldRequest` in `stage/heldRequests`), it goes with the other two and nothing travels (`landless` on `HomeScreen`), so no live pay control is ever seen over that screen. Coming back it comes up again as the scene's content leaves.

The balance is one element all the way to the strip: the hero itself shrinks to .34, and its unit holds a readable size as the figures shrink (the Odometer's `scaled`, `unitScaleFor`), 15pt in the strip where the scale alone would leave it at 5, so no second figure is ever drawn beside it. The hero rolls only when its value changes, money having moved. What it shows, the total at home and what can be spent while Send or Receive is open (`spendable` on `HomeScreen`), is a different figure, not money moving: Home draws each in an odometer of its own, both in the hero's one place and only one ever seen, so going between the two swaps the figure in place, at once, under the move, and it never rolls down as Send opens or up as Home comes back. The swap is made on the UI thread in the first frame the hero moves toward the scene that wants the other figure (`figureShown` in `scenes/home/motion`), so the full balance never changes before anything moves, where it reads as money gone, and the strip never changes while the scene it belongs to is still drawn whole; neither figure mounts or fades for it, so it never blinks.

**T3, Scan.** The disc reveal. On detection the circle collapses into the send well.

**T4, Row to Detail:**

| Time       | What happens                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0          | tick; the sheet moves to compact                                                                                                             |
| 0 to 90    | the other rows fade out on the enter curve, most of the way at once (`DETAIL_FADE`)                                                          |
| 0 to 140   | the other rows drop 8pt                                                                                                                      |
| 0 to 320   | the ring clone flies to the header (40 to 96)                                                                                                |
| 40 to 320  | the amount clone, still in its row until the ring has lifted clear of it (`AMOUNT_HOLD`), flies to its place under the ring, landing with it |
| 120 onward | lines stagger in, 40ms apart                                                                                                                 |

The ring starts beside the amount and lands above it, so flown together the two crossed; held back a sibling's stagger, the amount never meets the ring, and the clones only pass over rows that have all but faded as the sheet rises under them.

**T5, Home and Activity.** Driven by the gesture. Progress interpolates:

- hero scale: 1 to .34
- action row opacity: 1 to 0 over the first .4
- vessel opacity: 1 to 0 over the first .3
- filter bar: fades in over the last .6 to 1

Release on velocity over 800pt/s, or past 40% going up or 25% going down. Rubber band at .35 past the ends.

**T6, Settings.** The cog spins 120 degrees; the canvas scales to .94 and dims to .5; Settings slides in from the right. Swiping from the edge goes back.

**R-1, unlock:**

| Time        | What happens                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0           | success haptic; the bloom unfolds  |
| 500 to 880  | the bloom flies to the mark (28pt) |
| 600 to 1500 | the hero counts up                 |
| 650         | the sheet rises                    |
| 700         | the actions pop in, 50ms apart     |
| 750         | the rows stagger in, 30ms apart    |

**R-2, choosing a wallet.** The tapped control grows into the loader, which flies to the mark once a wallet id exists.

**R-3, skeleton to live.** The dots shrink as the digits roll in, the vessel draws, the actions brighten, the rows crossfade, and a sage ping plays.

**R-4, to offline.** The chase stops, the petals go dormant, and `unplug` pops in (warning haptic).

**R-5, offline to live.** The bloom re-saturates, bursts, and `unplug` splits apart (success haptic).

**R-6, live to closing, switching or erasing.** The sheet drops, the digits roll out, and the mark flies to center.

**How the canvas builds.** The stage tells the canvas how it arrives (`arrival`: `unlock`, `load` or `reconnect`, from the phase before the wallet's), and the canvas plays the build once, as it mounts, from `buildBeats(arrival)` in `stage/layout.ts`: the hero's beat is 600ms after an unlock, when the bud has unfolded, and 80ms after a load or a reconnect; the sheet follows 50ms later, the actions 100ms later and 50ms apart, the rows 150ms later and 30ms apart. The parts read the build with `useBuild()` from `stage/panes/Build` as they mount. The beats count from the canvas's first painted frame, not from its mount: every entrance runs on the steady clock, and the build's start (`began`) moves to that frame, so a part that mounts after a slow first frame still plays its entrance. A lock that opened before its bud showed (`QUIET_MS`) had nothing to unfold, so the canvas builds as after a load. The hero holds 0, unseen, until its beat, then fades up as it counts to the balance (its label always says the balance): the count is set going as the hero mounts and waits for its beat on the UI thread, on the steady clock as the fade does (the odometer's `countUp`), so the two set out together however busy the JavaScript thread is, and the wallet never reads as empty; the vessel draws out from its middle; the sheet rises from past the bottom edge on the pane spring; a reconnect bursts the mark and plays a success haptic. The build counts as a transition, so focus and safety messages wait for it. Leaving, the sheet drops away past the bottom edge and the figures drop and fade; the lock alone takes the canvas away with no exits. Under Reduce Motion every part crossfades in within 160ms and the hero does not count.

**Sure entrances.** On Android, Reanimated can stall a layout animation as the app starts, and the view it was entering keeps its first values for good: after one cold launch on a phone the activity sheet stayed below the screen and the status dot at nothing, while the rest of the canvas built. It could not be made to happen again on demand (Reanimated's #9608 was a stall of the same kind, fixed before 4.7.0). So the parts whose absence would mislead, the sheet, the hero, the vessel, the actions and the status dot, take their entrance through `useSureEntry` (`src/motion/sureEntry.ts`): the entrance says when it has ended, and one that has not ended `ENTRY_GRACE_MS` (2.5s) past its beat is taken to have stalled, and the view is drawn again under a new key with no entrance, where it rests. The sheet is drawn again with its rows, which then enter at once. An entrance that ends in time changes nothing.

## 8. Reduced motion

- Movement through space becomes a crossfade of 160ms or less, and loops become static states. The panes do not travel: the sheet, the balance and the action row fade out over the first 80ms, jump to their new place unseen, and fade back in over the next 80ms. A pane a gesture has already carried to its place needs no jump and no fade. A scene's content hands over the same way: the outgoing one fades over the first 80ms and the incoming one over the next, so the two are never drawn over each other.
- Countdown rings still deplete, and color thresholds still apply.
- Haptics are unchanged.
- Specific substitutions:
  - A static open bloom, with petals at .6 opacity plus `busy` while loading.
  - Values swap with a 120ms crossfade.
  - The arriving glass gets a static 45 degree hatch, drawn as the out-of-reach stripes are (5, Vessel).
  - Reconnecting is a hollow honey ring.
  - A shake becomes a 400ms radish tint.
  - The hold fill still runs.

## 9. Accessibility

- **Controls.** Every glyph control sets a role, a label, and its disabled, busy or selected state. Decorative SVG is hidden.
  - A `Pressable` keeps its role while it takes no touch, and a role that comes and goes is `'none'` while it is gone, never `undefined`: React Native's iOS props keep the previous role when the prop is removed, so a mark that stops being pressable would stay a button. `test-support/a11y.ts` checks both, the second by reading the source.
  - Fabric reuses a native view for whatever it draws next, and the macOS translation `idb` reads a simulator through keeps the role it read for each view earlier. So after moving between scenes a long-running `idb_companion` reports roles the views had before (a key as a heading, Close as a plain element), while a fresh companion reads the same screen correctly. Roles are read through a companion started after the last move.
- **Announcements.** A single `announce(text, {assertive})` helper.
  - The safety states announce assertively, once, through `announceSafety(message, kind)` in `src/motion/speech.ts`. It waits until no transition runs, no focus move is pending and the last one has had 400ms to land, so the canvas's focus move never cuts a message short. A move still pending is looked at again after 50ms on a timer, never by asking for the next idle moment at once: React Native runs idle callbacks back to back, so asking from inside one would keep the JavaScript thread from its timers, and a move that waits on one (`focusAfterTransition` with a delay) would never be made. States that begin together are said as one message, in the order held payment, stale balance, expired, reused address, backup, test network. A state that ends before it is heard is not said. The haptic and the diagnostic log entry are not delayed. An element whose words are announced this way is not also a live region, which Android would read a second time.
  - Only the scene in front announces a stale balance: Home stays quiet while Send or Receive is open, and after Send, which has said it, too.
  - Identical messages within 2s are dropped. A test starts with nothing said by calling `forgetSpoken()` from `src/design/announce.ts`, rather than moving the clock past the window.
- **Focus.** After each transition, focus moves to the new primary element.
  - Send moves it once the step has risen into view (`useLanding` in `scenes/send`), and says what the step announces only after the move, so the move never cuts an assertive message short. Its safety states (a held request, an unknown result, a stale balance and an expired quote) go through `announceSafety`, and a landing counts as a move on its way from the moment it is asked for, so they wait for it to land and settle. The rise is marked as a transition (`beginTransition`) while it runs, so the move, and a message waiting for it, wait with the rest of the work held for a still stage. A landing that waited on a timer of its own left the message asking again at every idle moment, and React Native runs idle callbacks back to back, so no timer fired until the next touch: the held haptic's second warning never played (P14). A review lands on its amount; a quote running out or the balance going stale lands on the control that takes the hold's place, and a fresh quote back on the amount; a result or the held ring on its mark; an edit, a retry or a refusal back in compose on the amount.
- **Home focus order:** mark, hero, vessel, Send, Scan, Receive, cog, sheet. TalkBack follows the tree, which is in that order. VoiceOver orders what shares a container by where each part starts, top to bottom and then left to right, whatever the tree says, so the geometry is set to agree: the three action circles sit in slots of one height, so they share a top edge, and the corner control hangs from an anchor that starts just under the home pane's top edge and above the sheet's, while it is drawn, and pressed, in the status row. Nothing on the canvas that a screen reader reaches may sit in a layer that starts at the top edge.
- **Shape as well as color.** Every state has a distinct shape.
- **Strings.** All strings live in `src/design/copy/`, one file per area (shared, home, activity, detail, send, receive, scan, phases, settings), composed into one `copy` object by its `index.ts`. The legacy phrases that tests assert are kept verbatim, for example:
  - "Total balance {n} sats"
  - "{a} sats ready to send, {p} sats arriving"
  - "Balances are unavailable until the connection is restored."
  - "Save your recovery phrase."
  - "Point at the code."
  - "Payment request QR code"
  - "Chicory stays locked until this is confirmed."
- **Phrases that must never appear** in labels: "Pull to refresh", "Welcome back", "Sent, just like that.", "Share this request.", "Explore a preview", "Connect a host".

## 10. Component contracts

The parallel tracks build these. Each exists now as a still placeholder at its final path with its final props, so the app runs, tests can target it, and a track can replace the inside without touching a caller. A signature changes only by agreement, because other tracks already call it.

### 10.1 Canvas

- **`src/stage/layout.ts`** (pure).
  - `stops(H, insets)`: `full` = `insets.top`, `compact` = `insets.top + 72`, `home` = `max(insets.top + 380, 0.5H)`, `gone` = `H + 24`. The canvas draws edge to edge, under the status bar, so it passes the real safe-area insets and measures `H` from its root `onLayout`.
  - `SCENE_LAYOUT`: each scene's `{ seam, hero, bar }`. Home is `home`/1/1; activity and detail are `compact`/0/0; send and receive are `gone`/0/0. Settings has none.
  - `canvasScene(state)` and `canvasLayout(state)`: under Settings the canvas keeps the pose of the scene it covers, plus `covered`.
  - `STATUS_ROW` (56), `HERO_MINI` (.34), `MINI_STRIP` (44), `COVERED` (scale .94, opacity .5), `SCANNING` (scale .96, opacity .5) and `PANE_SETTLE_MS` (340). `canvasLayout` also takes the overlay and answers `scanning` while the scan overlay is open, and `card` while a payment's detail is open, so opening or closing one is a move that takes the lock.
  - `veilOpacity(veil)`: the opacity of what the Reduce Motion crossfade covers, whole at either end of its clock and gone at the middle.
  - `SLOT_PADDING` (how far a scene's content sits inside its `SceneSlot`, which serves it too), `WELL` (72, the height of Send's request well) and `WELL_DROP` (where the well's centre sits below the status row, which a code read from home collapses into). The scan overlay reads these here rather than from a scene's module.
  - `HOME` (the home pane's measures: the page edge, the gap under the balance, its padding, the vessel's box and inset, the row's height, the circles and the air under them) and `heroBox(fontScale, ratio)` (the balance's box at the full hero size, which Home never lets shrink, so a step down such as BTC's moves nothing under it). The loading page draws its skeleton from them.
  - `PRIMARY_CONTROL` (88) and `launchLanding(width, height, insets)`: where Send's and Receive's primary control sits, bottom centre of the slot, which the tapped circle travels to, and `launchLook(scene, { live, test })`, how that control looks as its scene opens, which the circle takes on on the way. `stage/panes/Launch` carries the hand-over (`x`, `y`, `handover`); a scene puts `useLaunchLanding()`'s `ref` and `onLayout` on the view holding its control so the circle lands on it exactly, and its `style`, on an animated view around the control, holds the control unseen until the hand-over.
  - `MINI_STRIP` is the band under the status row that Send and Receive leave clear: the balance rests there as the mini strip while either is open. Under Activity and a payment's detail the sheet's compact stop leaves no band, so the strip rests in the middle of the status row instead, and the hero's landing springs between the two (`miniLanding` in `scenes/home/motion.ts`).
- **`src/stage/panes/Pane.tsx`**.
  - `Pane({ active, style })`: a layer of the canvas. When it is not active it gets `pointerEvents` `none`, `accessibilityElementsHidden` and `importantForAccessibility` `no-hide-descendants`. Panes nest.
  - `usePaneActive()`: whether the pane a component is drawn in is in use. It is true outside any pane.
  - `usePanes()`: the canvas's shared values: `seam` (the sheet's top edge in points), `hero` (0 is the mini strip, 1 the full balance), `bar` (the action row's opacity), `cover` (0 to 1 as Settings covers the canvas), `scan` (0 to 1 as the scan overlay opens over it), `pull` (how far a finger pulls the home pane down, in points, and 0 once it lets go; Home's pan writes it and the status row's mark opens with it), `veil` (the clock of the Reduce Motion crossfade, 1 at rest; the sheet and the balance take `veilOpacity` of it), and `stops`.
- **Rules for anything drawn on the canvas.**

  - A control in a pane passes its handlers (`onPress`, `onLongPress`, `onChangeText`, `onAccessibilityAction`) only while `usePaneActive()` is true. `Button`, `IconButton` and `Chip` take no touches without an `onPress`.
  - Panes stay mounted and only move. Scene content in a slot is keyed by the scene's key and enters with `sceneIn`. It leaves with `sceneOut`'s fade and settle, which the top slot plays as a style of its own (`SceneLeave` in `stage/panes/Leaving`), never as a layout exit (7, going back); Settings slides with `slideIn` and `slideOut`.
  - The stage actions are taps. A tap is refused while a pane moves, and otherwise starts the panes in its own tick. `setBusy`, the session's `tab` and `reset`, and payment links never wait on the lock. Android back is swallowed while a pane moves.
  - A gesture hands its speed to the move it ends in: `openActivity` and `home` take an optional `Fling` (`{ velocity }`, the sheet's speed in points a second), which `PaneMotion.follow(next, fling)` passes to the seam's spring, so a flung sheet carries on from the finger. A press event passed to either carries no speed.
  - `SceneSlot` takes `offset`, how far below the top of the safe area its parent starts, so a lower slot still clears the keyboard.
  - **Focus** (9). `useFocus(on)` in `src/motion/focus.ts` returns a ref a screen reader lands on whenever `on` turns true, once no transition is running; the phases and Settings use it, and `focusOn(node)` moves focus at once. On the canvas each region names its scene's primary element with `usePrimary()` from `stage/panes/Primary`: the `SceneSlot` header (Send, Receive, a payment's detail, Settings), Home's balance, and the open list's first filter, or its search field while a search is open and the filters are not drawn. The canvas moves focus there as each scene settles, and again as an overlay over it closes; while an overlay is open it moves nothing.

- **Regions.** The canvas places the regions, activates the panes and runs the motion; what each region draws lives with its scene under `src/scenes`. Every region takes the same `RegionProps` from `stage/Canvas`, whole: `snapshot`, `client`, `session` (the `CanvasSession`), `view` (the `CanvasView`, with `hidden`, `setHidden`, `unit` and `setUnit`), `stale`, `backup` and `arrived` (a count that goes up with each read that brought money in; the canvas calls `useIncoming` once, so every region keys its flash, burst or roll on the same arrival and the incoming haptic plays once; Receive, which watches its request itself, leaves a completed payment's haptic to it). It adds only what is its own, reads the stage actions from `useStage()`, and computes the rest itself, so a region that needs more of these never needs the canvas changed. In the top pane's order:
  - `scenes/home/Backdrop` (the ground, drawn first, behind everything and full bleed, under the status bar too; it draws the 3.2 gradients and the G3 tints from `snapshot`, `stale`, `backup`, `session` and `arrived`, and the tints the scenes ask for through the tint channel below);
  - `scenes/home/StatusRow` (`shown`; the mark and the connection at the left, the mark's value saying a failed refresh with its reason, and at home the backup's shield tile), `scenes/home/HomePane` (`home`; `hero` scales the balance, `bar` fades only the action row's circles, each on its own);
  - `panes/CornerControl`, which the canvas draws itself after Home, at the top right inside the top inset, so a screen reader reaches it in the home order (9). It is a 48pt target (`CORNER_TARGET`) around its glyph, hung `CORNER_REACH` nearer the edge so the glyph stays where the page edge puts it. Its `scale` draws the target and the glyph larger together, as Settings' close grows with the text (`glyphScale`). The status row leaves it `CORNER_ROOM`. Settings' bar and the new wallet sheet's header hang their close `CORNER_REACH` nearer the edge too, so it sits where the cog it replaces sat. The cog and the close are keyed apart, so the cog spins out as the close spins in (`spinOut`, `spinIn`; T1), and the canvas's cog turns `COG_TURN` (120 degrees) with `cover` (T6);
  - `scenes/send/SendScene` (`sceneKey`, `prefill`) and `scenes/receive/ReceiveScene` (`sceneKey`), in the top slot, arriving through `panes/Arriving` and leaving through `panes/Leaving`;
  - `scenes/activity/SheetPane` (`shown`; the grip at home, the one Activity list);
  - `scenes/detail/DetailLayer` (`item`, `from`; the `DetailCard` in the slot at the compact stop);
  - `scenes/settings/SettingsLayer`, whose root carries the copy guard's marker, `testID="scene-settings"`. `SettingsScreen` takes `backupPending` and `onBackupSaved` for the recovery phrase flow.
- **Settings-class surfaces** (rule 2) carry the copy guard's marker at their root, `SETTINGS_SURFACE` from `scenes/settings/ui`: `SettingsSurface` roots Settings, the new wallet sheet (`CreateSheet`) and a new wallet's recovery phrase over a shell phase (`BackupPanel`), and a phase's `SetupPanel` roots the setup it opens (network and device setup, the recovery phrase). The marker goes only on a surface that is settings-class itself: a phase's other controls stay glyphs outside it, so Offline's choose another wallet (`swap`) and lock (`lock`) sit under its panel, not in it. None is ever drawn beside another, so a tree holds at most one marker: Settings is never drawn with a phase, the stage draws `BackupPanel` in place of the phase, and a phase draws no setup panel under the new wallet sheet: the picker closes its network editor as it opens the sheet for restore or a wallet made there, and draws none under a sheet opened any other way, as restore from Welcome lands on it. The guard throws on a second marker rather than read past a surface that is not settings-class. The new wallet sheet slides over the phase with `slideIn` and `slideOut`, as Settings slides over the canvas, and so does the recovery phrase's surface.
- **Backup.** A pending backup reaches the regions as data, `backup: { pending, loadPhrase, onSaved } | null`, never as a rendered node. The canvas draws it only as glyphs: the honey halo on the mark, the shield tile beside it at home, and `scenes/activity/BackupShelf`, the shield pinned first on the open list, above the payments that need attention. Each opens Settings, which leads with the recovery phrase, through `openSettings`, so it waits while a pane moves as any tap does; the stage's table lets Activity open Settings for the shelf, and back from there returns to the list. Over a shell phase the stage draws it as a shield tile that opens `BackupPanel`. Nothing draws the phrase as the old screens did any more, so `scenes/shared/BackupBanner` is gone.
- **Tint channel.** A scene asks the ground for a G3 tint (3.2) through `StageContext` rather than laying one over its slot, and Send and Receive lay no ground of their own, so the backdrop shows through them. `useHoldTint(tint)` holds `'night'` or `'honey'` while `tint` is set and the caller is mounted (Receive holds night while an offline receive is chosen; Send holds honey while an outcome is unknown or a request is held); honey is a safety state and wins over night. `useFlashTint()` returns `flash('sage' | 'radish')`, which plays once (the receipt flashes sage as a paid request's petals burst; Send flashes radish as a payment fails). `useTint()` is what the backdrop reads: `{ held, flash: { tint, key } | null }`. The channel is a store of its own on the stage (`StageStore.tint`), so a change draws only the ground again; outside a stage every hook does nothing. The backdrop takes a flash within 3s of the last of its kind for the same moment, since a scene and the next read of the wallet often report one arrival or one failure twice.
- **Responders.** `useSceneBack(handler, active)` and `usePhaseBack(handler)` from `StageContext` answer Android back (2.2). `useScanReceiver(receiver, active)` takes a code scanned for the Send already open (2.3). Its `active` is `useIsCurrentScene(sceneKey)`, true while the scene keyed `sceneKey` is the one the stage shows, overlays aside, and never `usePaneActive()`, which the scan overlay turns false.

The Bloom also takes props its row leaves out:

- `breath?` `'whole' | 'center'`: what `breathe` moves. The whole flower is the default; `'center'` breathes the center alone while the petals hold still, for setup pending (6, Wallet health).
- `unfoldOnExit?` (ms): how the bloom leaves when its view is taken away. Each petal unfolds from where it stands to the full flower on the reveal spring as the unfold passes it (`unfoldExit`), the flower holds open while whatever carries it off moves it, and it fades in the last 140ms of the stay; its drawings keep their look rather than fade. Under Reduce Motion the petals dip out and come back open within a crossfade. Every part lasts the whole stay, since a part whose exit ends first is taken away early. The lock's bud leaves this way (R-1), carried by the flight to the mark over the same 880ms.

### 10.3 Keypad

The amount keypad (`src/scenes/keypad`) replaces the system keyboard for amounts in Send and Receive. The suites drive it only through `test-support/keypad.ts` (`enterAmount`, `amountValue`), so its labels are a contract, kept in `copy.keypad` (`src/design/copy/send.ts`):

- **Container.** One view labelled `copy.keypad.label`, "Amount keypad". Its presence is how `enterAmount` knows a keypad is drawn; without one it types into the `AmountField` instead.
- **Digit keys.** Each is a button labelled with its digit alone, `copy.keypad.digits[d]`, "0" to "9". While the amount is blank, zero and backspace change nothing, so they are dimmed and disabled, and a screen reader hears so.
- **Backspace.** A button labelled `copy.keypad.backspace`, "Delete last digit", with the hint `copy.keypad.backspaceHint`. `enterAmount` presses it until the amount reads empty, at most 16 times.
- **The amount.** Stays labelled `copy.amount.field`, "Amount in sats", and carries its digits in `accessibilityValue.text` (for example "4,200 sats"). An amount showing only zeros counts as empty. The label is only ever spoken, never drawn.
- **`AmountField` extras.** `empty` stands in the amount while it has no digits, in place of the dust 0 (Receive's infinity, or its dust 0 with a blinking caret). `tone` (`'honey' | 'radish' | 'dust'`) holds it against a limit: honey with a `clock` over what can be spent now, radish with a `bang` and one shake past what it can ever be, dust with a `sprout` under the least it can be, each glyph on its tone's disc (5, Keypad). Each change of `shake` shakes it once more. Its keys take touches only while its pane is in use.
- **Presets** stay chips labelled with the amount alone, as `copy.amount.preset` formats it.

### 10.4 Motion helpers

Shared by every glyph and scene, in `src/motion` (tokens and presets aside):

- **`loops.ts`.** `useLoop(period, running, ambient?)` is the one loop clock: it counts a cycle every `period` ms and eases to the nearest whole cycle when it stops, or at the ambient rest on to the next one, slowing from its own speed (`restEase`), and it rests wherever nobody would see it move (the app in the background, its pane out of use, Reduce Motion), and, when `ambient`, while decoration rests (3.5). A loop that turns reads `fract(clock)`; one that goes out and back, a breath or a pulse, reads `wave(clock)`, so a whole breath is one period. `useAwake()` is whether a loop here would be seen.
- **`ambient.ts`.** The ambient clock (3.5): `useAmbientRest(ambient?)` for a loop of its own, such as the backdrop's swings, `wakeAmbient()` for a change worth seeing, and `wakeOnTouch`, the capturing responder props the stage's root carries. Only ambient listeners keep its timer, so with no decoration on screen none runs.
- **`springMath.ts`.** `springStep`, `kickVelocity` and `kick`, for poses computed from a clock on the UI thread and for pops that start from rest.
- **`steady.ts`.** `steady(animation)` runs any animation on the steady clock (3.5), and `steadyClock` is its arithmetic.
- **`effects.ts`.** `useShake()` (a shake, or a 400ms radish tint under Reduce Motion), `popIn(from?)` and `dissolve()` for something that arrives or is let go of as a whole.
- **`focus.ts`.** `useFocus(on)`, `focusOn(node)` and `focusAfterTransition(target, { delay, then })`, which counts the move as pending from the call until it is made, after `delay` ms and once no transition runs, and runs `then` after it (10.1, Focus).
- **`speech.ts`.** `announceSafety(message, kind)`, which holds a safety message until focus has landed (9, Announcements). Tests call `forgetSafety()` to drop what one test left waiting.
- `mixHex(from, to, t)` and `alpha(hex, a)` are colour helpers in `src/design/palette.ts`.

## 11. Track ownership

The parallel tracks each edit only the files they own, so they never touch the same file and merge without conflicts. A track that needs a shared file changed asks the integrator instead of editing it. Each track adds the states it redraws to its own guard file under `__tests__/guards`, drawn from `test-support/fixtures.ts`, and its words to its own file under `src/design/copy/`.

- Shared (integrator only, no track edits): `App.tsx`, `src/stage/{Canvas,Stage,StageContext,scene,phase,layout,useBackHandler,useScanReceiver}.ts(x)`, `src/stage/panes/**`, `src/motion/**`, `src/design/{palette,glyphs,glyphLengths,haptics,announce}.ts(x)`, `src/design/copy/{index,shared}.ts`, `src/theme.ts`, `src/components/ui.tsx`, `src/screens/{Wallet,Payments}.tsx` (re-export shims), `test-support/**`, `jest.setup.js`, `.eslintrc.js`, `__tests__/{LabelContract,CopyGuard,A11yCoverage,StorageContract,SceneReducer,Phase,BackNavigation,ScanOverlay}.test.*`, `__tests__/{CanvasMotion,Contracts,TestSupport}.test.tsx` (but see below)

- Any other source file not named above is shared: a track that needs it changed asks the integrator. Track G may edit only the launch files named above under `ios/` and `android/`, and no track edits any other native file.
- **Native files of the privacy cover** (6, the native cover and Android recents): on iOS the cover in `ios/chicory/AppDelegate.swift`; on Android the recents rule in `android/app/src/main/java/com/chicory/MainActivity.kt`. They belong to the privacy cover and are shared, as the stage is; `__tests__/NativePrivacyCover.test.ts` reads them.
- Existing test suites are edited by the track whose surface they exercise; where two tracks must edit the same suite, each edits only the tests (it blocks) for its own surface.
- `__tests__/CanvasMotion.test.tsx`, `__tests__/Contracts.test.tsx` and `__tests__/TestSupport.test.tsx` are shared, with one allowance: a track may update the assertions in them that inspect its own region's internals (for example CanvasMotion's `homeParts` for the home track), and nothing else.
- **Copy.** A track may read any area's words, but adds new strings only in its own area file. A string another area owns is duplicated into its own area rather than edited where it is. Track D owns the keypad words: `copy.keypad` in `send.ts`, which `index.ts` also serves as `copy.amount.backspace` and `copy.amount.backspaceHint`.
- **Moved at integration.** Once every track had merged, the helpers the tracks kept in their own files for want of a shared one moved to shared files: the loop, awake and spring helpers from `glyphs/Bloom.tsx` and the loop, shake, pop and dissolve from `scenes/send/motion.ts` to `src/motion` (10.4), `mixHex` and `alpha` to the palette, and `useFocus` from `scenes/settings/ui.tsx` to `src/motion/focus.ts`, which also replaces the phases' own arrival hook. Receive's own clocks for its orbit, moon and caret (`scenes/receive/loops.tsx`) and its refusal tint followed later, onto `useLoop` and `useShake`. `useIncoming` is called once, by the canvas. Home's `GestureRoot` and `PullBloom`, and `components/CopyValue.tsx`, are gone.
- **Bottom inset.** The canvas runs to the bottom edge, under the system bars. Each region that runs to the bottom edge (home, sheet, detail, send, receive and Settings) applies the bottom safe-area inset itself, so Android's 3-button bar never covers its content.
